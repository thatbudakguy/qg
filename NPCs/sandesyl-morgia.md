# Sandesyl Morgia

# Appearance

Gaunt moon elf woman with silvery hair and high, noble cheekbones. Wearing a long, flowing gown that shimmers in the light.

# Roleplaying

- Cool and calculating, viewing people only for their potential use as tools.
- Speaks in arcane, flowery language because she’s over 1000 years old.

# Background

The Morgias were once one of the great families of Evermeet, but great wasn’t enough: they needed to be the greatest. The price for that ambition turned out to be undeath — [name] Morgia’s patron, who provided the family with a near endless source of wealth, was a vampire who sought inroads into one of the only communities on Toril that had kept his kind out since the dawn of time.

When the treachery of the Morgias was finally exposed, they were exiled to Toril, where their resentment only festered further. 

Met Sammaster in 905 DR who accepted her family, the rest of whom have died

With the fall of Skyreach, Sandesyl has found herself smack-dab in the middle of another reclusive Elven society. She is only too happy to begin the process of inserting herself into its midst and poisoning it from within, ready to turn it into a new cult stronghold.

Sandesyl uses *disguise self* if she is anywhere near the PCs, who have seen her true form previously, but otherwise appears as herself to Elves who don’t know her face. The night after the castle crashes, she charms a Vine Vale soldier into carrying some of her grave dirt into Evereska to establish a new lair.

# Key Info

- Severin Silrajin, who calls himself the Red Wyrmspeaker, is a usurper and no valid heir to Sammaster, but he is our best chance at cleansing this world of its filth.
- There is an active [Eldreth Valuuthra](../factions/Eldreth%20Valuuthra.md) cell in Evereska who understand that the Dragons are our greatest ally against the “low races”.
