# Meloon Wardragon

Meloon is tall and broad, a giant of a man, with a scraggly blonde beard and a big smile. He laughs often and loudly, and talks slowly. He wields a beautiful magical battleaxe covered in runes and gems that sometimes radiates blue light.

Meloon served as a personal bodyguard to [Laraelra Harsard](Laraelra%20Harsard.md) for many years before joining [Renaer Neverember](Renaer%20Neverember.md)'s Moonstars together with her, and the two have a strong bond. He was gravely injured in the assault on Kryptgarden forest, but made a full recovery with the assistance of his friends.
