# Davil Starsong

[DM Notes](../campaign/pcs/declan-truefire/DM%20Notes.md)

Davil is part of the Doom Raiders, a group of unscrupulous adventurers who liked to plunder lich lairs. His gang ultimately gave up adventuring in favor of more steady "employment" managing the Waterdeep division of the Black Network.
