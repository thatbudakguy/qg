As the matriarch of the Moss family, Millivent presides over a prosperous peat farm in the small hamlet of Kabel's Hill outside Phlan. Her large and growing family includes her husband, Haldred, sons Quayle and Volland, daughters Alleena and Kithian, and infant Bo.

The Moss family hires several farmhands each harvest season to help bring in the peat, and Declan did a brief stint as a laborer alongside a few others in the fall of 1509. As a reward, Millivent sent the Quarantine Gang an [Invitation to Highharvesttide](../Handouts/%E2%9C%89%EF%B8%8F%20Invitation%20to%20Highharvesttide.md), and they spent the  [Highharvesttide](../Adventure%20Log/Highharvesttide.md) holiday dining with the Moss family.
