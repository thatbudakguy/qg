# Glevith

A Tethyrian with tanned skin and a weather-worn face often set into a smirk, Glevith is tall and lanky. He keeps his hair pulled back or to one side and speaks with a gravelly voice.

As local boss of the Welcomers, Glevith runs Phlan's version of a thieves' guild. He preaches revolt against the Black Fist, but also seems pretty interested in lining his own pockets. Although he despises the noble houses for failing to support the common folk of Phlan under martial law, he has to admit that it's good for business...when your business is smuggling and thievery.

The Gang first encountered Glevith in the upper floor of the Laughing Goblin inn. Since then, he's frequently been found at Madame Freona's Tea Kettle in the company of Chaab, a fence associated with the [zhentarim](../factions/zhentarim.md).
