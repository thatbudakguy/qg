# Eryn

This large dragonhide-bound tome was recovered by the Gang from the belongings of Jeralla, the leader of the Claws of Tiamat, who was killed in the battle at King's Pyre. It appears to have some level of sentience, being able to float in the air and manipulate its pages along with a quill. The contents of the book are mostly flowery descriptions of the glory of Jeralla, evidently recorded during her time as the self-identified Chosen of Tiamat.

When the book was examined by the [lord-sage](lord-sage.md) and [aya-glenmiir](aya-glenmiir.md), they concluded that it contained the spirit of a once-living humanoid – perhaps a woman. The magic needed to imprison a spirit in such a way, however, is a closely guarded arcane secret considered taboo for any wizard with a conscience. Binding the spirit into the book would have required the talents of someone both highly skilled and morally corrupt.

In [Sky Prince](../logbook/Sky%20Prince.md), Declan added simple phrases like "yes" and "maybe" to the book so that it could communicate by pointing, along with letters of the alphabet. Identifying itself as Eryn, the book seemed to suggest that it had been unwillingly bound to serve Jeralla and tell her story, perhaps as a gift to Jeralla by an entity it named "R". Eryn seemed willing to continue accompanying the Quarantine Gang on their adventures.

# Character

## Background

Born in the Elven Court area of Cormanthor during the Elven kingdom's brief return to glory in 1377 DR, Eryn Ainath was a joy to everyone – most of all her parents, Chaedi and Erdan. During a time when the Elves of Faerun had more hope than in any of the centuries past, Eryn's birth and life represented the pinnacle of that hope: a child who delighted in songs and stories, knowing nothing of the cruel history of her people.

Yet the girl's strong will could not be controlled, and to the devastation of her parents she left the forest in search of adventure while still a child, in 1420. Joining up with the Harpers for the promise of adventure, Eryn trained in the Silver Marches, pledging to keep the North safe from threats both arcane and divine.

## Interactions

# Timeline

- In the early 1450s DR, the [Harpers](../factions/Harpers.md) were keeping a close eye on the [Arcane Brotherhood](../factions/Arcane%20Brotherhood.md)'s attempts to control the North, particularly the Silver Marches. Harper agents had long suspected that correspondence continued between the brotherhood and the [Red Wizards of Thay](../factions/Red%20Wizards%20of%20Thay.md) and other agents to the East.
- When [Thurndan Tallwand](../Thurndan%20Tallwand/%21index.md) (then known by his birth name Rastol Shan) was publicly exiled from Mulmaster in 1390 for affiliation with the Brotherhood, the Harpers watched him closely. Reports came in from agents in the north that Rastol was bound for Hellgate Keep, a city of demons which had been razed by Khelben hardly 30 years before.
- Rastol spent years scouring the ruins of the Keep, establishing himself as an itinerant mage in the area so as to build a cover story. The Harpers were happy to let him continue to occupy himself with whatever he was doing, confident he would not succeed in his task, since the site had been utterly destroyed by the use of the *Gatekeeper's Crystal*. They did not suspect that the *Crystal* was precisely what he was looking for.
- When Rastol suddenly abandoned Hellgate Keep and appeared in Luskan at the Host Tower of the Arcane in 1456 DR, Eryn was immediately assigned to keep close tabs on him. By this point Rastol was completely paranoid and using a high degree of anti-scrying magic, and the Harpers were determined to keep him under wraps for fear of what he had somehow discovered in the ruins.
- Posing as an impressionable young wizard, Eryn apprenticed herself to Shan. She soon found the mage completely transfixed by the power of the crystal's shard, and utterly devoted to research that he believed would allow him to use it to conquer the North. In the first year of their research together, the pair discovered something neither expected: the *Crystal* was both a weapon and a key, one designed to prevent *gate*s from ever being closed.
- Convinced that the *Crystal* would allow him to summon an extraplanar army capable of conquering the entire North, Rastol applied himself to a ritual he believed would complete the summoning. Eryn did everything in her power to secretly confuse and confound the mage, ensuring that his tools were lost or broken, and his valuable research met with unfortunate ends.
- Yet eventually Rastol's behavior began to change. The mage grew more and more distrustful of his apprentice, and Eryn sounded the alarm with the Harpers in 1479 DR, believing that he had become truly dangerous. In fact, the game was already up: Tyranthraxus had possessed Rastol, and was simply biding his time to let Eryn think she was the one in control.
- When the call went out to the Harper agents, the Great Possessor's hand was forced: he *imprison*ed Eryn and disappeared in 1480 DR, before the agents could zero in on his position. Finding the residents of Luskan downright unwilling to cooperate with their investigation, the Harpers were forced to concede defeat and wait for Rastol to resurface somewhere in the North, their efforts soon becoming focused on the War of the Silver Marches.

# Character Sheet

The book appears to float in the air (up to 20 feet off the ground) as though continually under the effects of a *levitate* spell. It can push against other objects or carry up to the same weight as *mage hand (*10 lbs). It has blindsight out to a radius of 30ft, and is blind beyond this radius.

The book can engage in a limited form of communication by using its pages to "point" to words that have already been written there. Because it was cursed to tell Jeralla's story, it is incapable of writing new words unless they are about Jeralla (who is dead). If the curse is lifted (e.g. by a *remove curse* spell), the book is capable of writing using an ordinary quill as it pleases onto the pages.

To free the spirit of Eryn from the book, one would need to:

- Know Eryn's name and background
