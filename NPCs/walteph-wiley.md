# Walteph Wiley

A stern human male in his late 40s with a piercing gaze and a fatherly air, "Captain Walt" manages the crew of the *Kite*, a cog based out of Phlan that plies the Moonsea on behalf of the Sokol family. He is a kind man who takes his leadership role very seriously.

Walt is originally from Cormyr, where he served in the merchant marine and initially took up worship of Selune, the goddess of the moon.
