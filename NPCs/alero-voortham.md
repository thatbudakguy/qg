# Alero Voortham

An older human male with a lined face often set in a frown, Alero speaks with a sort of Jimmy Stewart-esque mid-atlantic drawl. As the resident weaponsmith of Phlan, he owns a shop diagonally opposite to [bryce-vang](bryce-vang.md) on Steel Avenue in the northeastern part of the city.

Alero's shop serves all who require a blade, but the Black Fist make up a large part of his steady business, and the shrewd smith is loath to do anything that would endanger his primary stream of revenue.
