# Bryce Vang

A portly human male in his mid-40s who wears a leather apron when at work. He speaks in a kind, slow voice with slight drawl, and addresses customers respectfully as "Mister" or "Miss".

Bryce is the proprietor of Vang's Armory in Phlan. The shop is located on crossroads of a residential district in the northeastern part of the city, sometimes called "New Phlan", at the top of a hill on Steel Ave, making him a neighbor of [alero-voortham](alero-voortham.md).

Bryce keeps a forge in the rear of his shop, and as a result the interior is perpetually smoky. He is occasionally interrupted in dealings with customers by his 4-year-old son, Butler.
