# Eiruk Weskur

Eiruk is short and slim, with close-cropped black hair â€“ the opposite of his good friend [renaer-neverember](renaer-neverember.md). He is reserved and occasionally sarcastic.

As an accomplished abjurer, Eiruk has served with Waterdeep's Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors for many years, and is currently a senior member.
