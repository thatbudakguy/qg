# Erlan Duirsar

# Appearance

Short, thin elven man with silver hair and a face showing a surprising amount of age, wearing simple white fabrics.

# Roleplaying

- Sighs wearily before speaking, especially when presiding over the council of Hill Elders.

# Background

Watcher over the Hills for more than two centuries, High Lord Duirsar has presided over Evereska at the height of peacetime and the depths of war. Though he once favored isolation, like nearly all of his predecessors, Erlan nearly witnessed the LastHome’s annihilation at the hands of the Daemonfey. What saved his city was outside help from Seiviril Miritar’s crusade, a fact Erlan never forgot.

Yet recent events have tempered Duirsar’s enthusiasm and aged him terribly. Evereska sent three thousand of its best to defend Myth Drannor 23 years ago, answering his debt of nearly a century, but less than two hundred returned to the LastHome. Feeling his many years more than ever, Lord Duirsar wants only to protect the city he calls home at the least cost of Elven lives: more precious than ever.

# Key Info

- Evereska was attacked by Daemonfey nearly 150 years ago, and lost hundreds of lives defending the city, but was saved by a crusade of Elves from Evermeet.
- 23 years ago Myth Drannor called in this debt, and Duirsar sent thousands of his best and brightest. The city fell, and only a few hundred returned to their home.
- Elves of the Misty Forest have been suffering from raids at the hand of dragons. King Melandrach has sought Evereska’s guidance.
- Duirsar has a finch named Manynests that he uses to communicate discreetly with other council members or elves through the city.
