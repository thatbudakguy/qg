Rescued from a nameless, rain-drenched island off the coast of the Northern Moonsea by the Quarantine Gang, this disheveled girl of about 8 years proved her extraordinary determination by stowing away on a rowboat with the adventurers. Often turning up when least expected, she stabilized fallen party members during their battle with Ixas, a Wearer of Purple of the [Cult of the Dragon](../factions/Cult%20of%20the%20Dragon.md).

Upon returning to Phlan, she was given into the care of [Yovir Glandon](Yovir%20Glandon.md) and the followers of Kelemvor, who promised to put her considerable energy to work in the ongoing restoration of Valhingen Graveyard.
