Ontharr is a friendly and hot-tempered human paladin whose massive beard conceals his [Order of the Gauntlet](../factions/Order%20of%20the%20Gauntlet.md) pendant. He is often wearing plate armor resplendent with a sun-and-star motif, the emblem of his hometown.

Ontharr serves as the resident head of the [Order of the Gauntlet](../factions/Order%20of%20the%20Gauntlet.md) in Elturel, capital of the theocratic nation of Elturgard in the Western Heartlands of Faerun. As a Vindicator, he commands many paladins, clerics, and fighters loyal to Torm, god of justice. He maintains a strong friendship with [Leosin Erlanthar](Leosin%20Erlanthar.md), with whom he nevertheless disagrees on most things.

At the battle of Kryptgarden, Ontharr was grievously wounded and lost an arm, though he made a full recovery with the aid of some of the assembled clerics of Torm. As a reward for her bravery in dealing with King Witchthorn, Ontharr gave [Calcey Firecrotch](Calcey%20Firecrotch/%21index.md) an [Order of the Gauntlet](../factions/Order%20of%20the%20Gauntlet.md) pendant in the aftermath of the battle.
