# Invitation to Highharvesttide

Type: ✉️ Letter

*Young Declan,*

*Our Haldred is always saying, "it's easy to halve the potato where there's love". I know you've hardly spent a tenday with us bringing in the peat, but we'd be ever so pleased if you'd join us for a feast this Highharvesttide. It's an extra special occasion, as Volland's just been engaged to marry miss Hadley of the Scheimer Barley farm.*

*If you've got kin in the city bring them along, and if no kin friends are just as well. All the little ones are looking forward to seeing you again, and myself most of all.*

*All Chauntea's Blessings,*

*Millivent*
