# Letter to Porphyrys Cadorna in Basement

Type: ✉️ Letter

*Councilman,*

*I have been assured by the Lord of the Ruins that all is in order. The Wizard Shal Bal has been "allowed" to discover the location of the Pool, and it will not be long before she and her friends delve below Valjevo Keep.*

*Tonight, we make our move. Either the adventurers vanquish the Great Possessor and inaugurate a new era for Phlan, or we are rid of a thorn in our side that has grown far too inquisitive of late - either way, we win.*

*Ever your servant,*

*Gensor*
