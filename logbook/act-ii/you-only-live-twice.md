# You Only Live Twice

Date: October 1, 2021

- As the furious melee continues to rage in the Outer Ward of Castle Naerytar's courtyard, [Declan Truefire](../Characters/Declan%20Truefire/%21index.md) is joined in his battle with a Dragonwing by two of the surviving Lizardfolk, most of whose compatriots are lying dead at their feet. Meanwhile, [Calcey Firecrotch](../Characters/Calcey%20Firecrotch/%21index.md) continues to get up close and personal with Dralmorrer Borngray and [Hagar Bloodrop](../Characters/Hagar%20Bloodrop/%21index.md) and [Peregrine Buntly](../Characters/Peregrine%20Buntly/%21index.md) square off with the remaining cultists.
- Hemmed in on both sides by cult forces and the charging Guard Drakes, [Sirge Wintermelt](../Characters/Sirge%20Wintermelt/%21index.md) and [leosin-erlanthar](../../npcs/leosin-erlanthar.md) fight for their lives. The monk's stunning strikes catch the big dragon-dogs off-guard more than once, but Sirge is quickly overwhelmed and twice pulled back from the brink of death by Declan's intervention.
- As the rest of the gang begin to focus their attention on Borngray, the elf's confidence begins to waver, and he eventually decides to make a break for the dungeons while he still breathes. Expending a usage of *misty step* to escape *Villona's black goo,* the cult commander has nearly reached the Southwest tower when a well-placed crossbow bolt from Calcey brings him down. With his last breath, he curses the gang to suffer all the many pains of the Mere of Dead Men.
