# Turn Your Head and Cough

Date: May 5, 2021

- Strolling down from Mountainside to visit the Yawning Portal, the gang inquire after [Davil Starsong](../Characters/Davil%20Starsong/%21index.md) and the Doom Raiders. After a short while, Davil and [ziraj-the-hunter](../../npcs/ziraj-the-hunter.md) arrive and are pleasantly surprised when [Hagar Bloodrop](../Characters/Hagar%20Bloodrop/%21index.md) reveals the true identities of the disguised gang.
- In Davil's room, the gang share a meal of Quippers and chips with some cherry wine courtesy of the [zhentarim](../../factions/zhentarim.md). Declan asks for some details about the Doom Raiders' activities during the battle of Kryptgarden, while Davil in turn questions the gang about their knowledge of the involvement of the [red-wizards-of-thay](../../factions/red-wizards-of-thay.md). Davil speculates that the mages are cooperating with the [cult-of-the-dragon](../../factions/cult-of-the-dragon.md) in order to assist with the ritual to bring Tiamat back to the material plane.
- After parting ways with the Doom Raiders, the gang and [Sirge Wintermelt](../Characters/Sirge%20Wintermelt/%21index.md) return to Roarke House to seek the counsel of [renaer-neverember](../../npcs/renaer-neverember.md). The young lord doesn't entirely trust the Zhent captains, but encourages the gang not to judge a book by its cover. Hagar recommends the services of Captain Calvin Bramblebottom for Lord Neverember's nautical needs.
- Reviewing what they know, the gang debate whether and how to pursue the caravan and initiate contact with [leosin-erlanthar](../../npcs/leosin-erlanthar.md). Deciding on a *sending* spell, they give Leosin an opportunity to acknowledge their presence and confirm he's not in danger by coughing, so as not to blow his cover. The response, to everyone's surprise, is a single cough.
