# S.E.A.L. Team 2.5

Date: October 25, 2020

- Seeing the Grey Patriot longship at anchor off King's Pyre, the crew of the *Kite* ask the gang what exactly their motives are in traveling here, and who might await them at the statue. Walt brings the gang down to his stateroom for a conference.
- Hagar summons a seagull to the deck of the *Kite* and convinces it to do a little reconnoitering for the gang. The seagull accepts his offer of a ration and flies over to King's Pyre, giving Hagar a good view of the two outlaw camps and the anchored longship, all of which look to be hives of activity.
- Watching the gang debate their next move, Capt. Walt offers a piece of advice: move out under cover of night, using one of the *Kite*'s rowboats. The gang accept this as likely their best chance to get close undetected.
- Accepting Walt's offer of equipment, the gang scour the hold of the *Kite* for equipment and grab an assortment of adventuring gear. After a final dinner with the crew, Walt makes an inspiring speech that fills the gang with hope for the coming night raid.
- Setting out with Peregrine and Hagar at the oars, the gang approach the longship under cover of darkness. As they draw nearer, it's evident the Patriots have doubled the guard on the longship and are on high alert. Declan uses a few cantrips to draw their attention to the opposite side of the boat.
- Just as the rowboat draws up alongside the longship, one of the bandits peers over the side right into the faces of the gang. Peregrine freezes him in his tracks with a *hold person* and the rest of the gang clamber over the side to give the Patriots a taste of steel.
- Making quick work of the four bandits, the gang gain control of the longship, uncovering a cargo of weapons and a mysterious letter addressed to a Sergeant. Tossing the weapons overboard, they clamber back into the dinghy and row it into the sea cave behind the longboat.
- By the light of Declan's lantern, the gang don Grey Patriot cloaks and prepare themselves for a journey through the caves inside King's Pyre.
