# Apex Predators

Date: August 9, 2020

- After spending a second night in the woods, the gang happens upon a dead body around midmorning. Closer inspection reveals it's likely one of the emissaries from Kabel's Hill. The body is decomposed and full of arrows, giving off a strong smell.
- As the gang is investigating the scene, a terrifying six-legged beast emerges from the woods and sizes them up. Serelis circles the wagons, but before they can mount a defense a second beast charges out of the woods behind them and goes for the attack.
- In the ensuing fray the gang struggles to land hits on the beasts, which seems to phase in and out when struck. The beasts wield their spike-tipped tentacles to good effect, knocking out Calcey and seriously wounding several others.
- Eventually the beasts flee, and Declan brings one down with a fire bolt from distance. Hagar cuts off the paw to save as a trophy. Serelis discovers the traces of the other beasts' flight, and the gang decides to pursue it and finish the job.
- Tracking the second beast to its lair, the gang are again ambushed. This time, Calcey delivers the killing blow. Hagar butchers the animal and leaves its strange limbs in a bloody heap at the front of the den.
- Inside, the gang discovers another mauled body along with cash and assorted gewgaws that the beasts collected from their prey.
