## Out Of Time
Arriving at the library of the College of Magic, the gang meet Alyn, the blue-haired student who is assigned to the front desk at this late hour. After inquiring about the rumors of the Vampire and the "dragon-worshippers", Alyn consents to lead the party up in the great Shadowtop tree whose trunk houses the books and archives of the College.

On one of the lower levels, Declan and Peregrine are able to find a thick tome of Elvish genealogy that tells the history of the Morgia family, from which Sandesyl the vampire is descended. Evidently long ago in the history of Evermeet, the secluded island off the coast of Faerun, the Morgias were a powerful and influential Elf clan with ambitions on the throne. But the patriarch of the family made a deal with a Vampire, which ultimately resulted in their exile to the mainland, and the turning of the family members who survived.

Ascending further into the library, the gang find two volumes on the characteristics of vampires, covering the association of vampires with animals and the ways in which vampires consume blood. Alyn suggests going all the way to the 66th floor, where they find the archive of a wizard who gave his name as Boris. Here, among the collection of strange and magical items, Peregrine discovers a small journal entitled simply _On the Efficient Destruction of Vampires_. Though written in a self-important tone, the book dispenses a wealth of advice for the would-be vampire hunter.

With research completed, the gang decide to rendezvous with Trueshot in the Vine Vale and request an escort for their foray into the caves of the Passage. On the way out, Calcey attempts to steal one of the magical wands in the archive, but is caught by Araevin.  The group fill up their canteens with water from the Singing Spring, hoping it will serve as a weapon against the vampire. At the entrance to the passage, they are questioned by the posted guards, who Declan orders to remove their masks so they are more identifiable.

During their trip down to the Vine Vale, the gang are alert for any signs that the vampire is near. Calcey has a brief encounter with a swarm of bats, unnerving the rest of the group. Araevin promises to remember the location from which the bats emerged. Once they arrive at the camp, the party briefs Trueshot on the situation, and confirms that the attack at the Floating Gardens was real. Before the discussion can proceed any further, Trueshot is interrupted by a soldier who breathlessly informs him that scouts have detected intruders on their way through the Greycloak Hills: dragons are coming.
