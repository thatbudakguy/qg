##  Graveyard Smash

As the arcane glyphs flare to life, the gang tangles with zombies made from a mishmash of human and draconic parts. No sooner do Hagar and Calcey strike down zombies than they are raised up by bursts of necrotic energy from the glyphs on the wall.

The gang acts quickly to disable the glyphs, but Peregrine's spiritual weapon becomes trapped behind a force field in the alcove until Declan finishes off the final glyph. With the zombies and necromantic magic cleansed, Calcey moves into the alcove to discover its "hoard" is made of worthless painted wooden disks.

Investigating the teleportation circle inscribed into the ground, Hagar concludes that the metal rod in its center has a destination sigil sequence inscribed on it. Declan copies down the sequence and then tries to destroy the rod with fire, eventually settling for just taking it with him.

Back in the laboratory, the gang stay well clear as Declan pours the clay pot into the cauldron. A violent alchemical reaction ensues that quickly blankets the crypt in choking necrotic fog. As the gang make their way back upstairs, they are set up on by the (now unarmed) reanimated skeletons from the throne room.

Casting about in the swirling fog, the gang struggle to fend off the skeletons until Peregrine's *detect evil and good* allows him to charge into the room and crush two of them in a matter of seconds. Hagar nearly outruns the end of his "leash", clotheslining Calcey in the process. Declan is choked by a skeleton until he summons *Maximilian's earthen grasp* to choke back, which pulverizes the final skeleton.

Emerging from the tomb, the gang hurriedly re-seal it to prevent necrotic mist from escaping any further. With no clear idea of the direction of the Kelemvorite temple, they wander for some time in the huge graveyard until returning to the offices and finding Yovir and Simon to tell the tale of the Welltran crypt.

In recognition of their dangerous sojourn, Yovir commits to a price of 1000gp in case of a gang member needing to be resurrected via a *raise dead* spell. He also agrees to scribe the gang an *identify* scroll and provides Declan with a receipt to take to Braden Yil for reimbursement.

Upon examining his pack, Declan finds that the rod with teleportation glyphs has magically dissolved into ash - perhaps a curse to prevent its being removed. The gang briefly stop by Alero's smithy to pawn the swords taken from the skeletons, and then trudge back out to Kabel's Hill for a meal and some shuteye.
