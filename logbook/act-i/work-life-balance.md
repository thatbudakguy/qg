##  Work-Life Balance

The gang descend back into the catacombs beneath Valhingen graveyard. Peregrine spies no sign of undead or other enemies that have disturbed the upper catacombs, though there are signs that the clerics of Kelemvor have used this area recently.

Coming to the collapsed stairwell they left on their most recent excursion here, the gang take turns trying to hammer in a piton and rope to make the descent. Declan takes a fall on the way down, but eventually everyone makes it into the lower catacombs, where the Kelemvorites have not ventured for some time.

Revisiting the location of their Welcomer rescue, Declan examines the monolith in one of the burial rooms and concludes its Celestial inscription is a description of the good deeds committed by those who are buried there.

At the location of the speaking skulls, the gang address questions about the pool of radiance to several spirits but receive no answer.  Peregrine surmises that some kind of *speak with dead* like spell was cast here once, but its magical energy has now dissipated.

Entering the tomb of Sedrair II, Declan carefully uses *mage hand* to rebalance the scales held by the mummified statue. Once the dust has been cleared off and many combinations have been shuffled around, the balance is zeroed out - evidently to no effect.

Making a move on Sedrair's gilded crown, the *mage hand* lifts it off atop the mummy's head and triggers an arcane trap that shoots bolts of lighting outside and around the corner of the room to strike most of the gang. In the surge of energy, the crown is melted and damaged.

Calcey determines that the crown could've been worth substantially more before its destruction, and that the gilded dagger Sedrair held in her other hand is unfortunately only a lightly painted replica. Her conclusion is that the weights ultimately had nothing to do with the trap, though they could have aided the tricky process of disabling it.

Proceeding through the lower catacombs, the gang come to the squalid room in which they battled the Red Wizard, still strewn with corpses. Investigating the tunnel, they conclude that no one has extended it since their last visit. Calcey feels a dampness that suggests the tunnel could lie underneath the Stojanow River, placing it close to the floor plan of Valjevo Castle.

Hagar and Calcey expend some sweat digging a few feet more down the tunnel's end, concluding that whoever was doing this work in the past wasn't relying on shovel power. The gang resolve to leave the catacombs, given the lack of evidence of any return to this place.
