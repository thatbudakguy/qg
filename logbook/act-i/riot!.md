##  Riot!

Just as Calcey makes her way to the front of the assembled crowd, a large bystander inadvertently knocks her to the ground as he harangues the Black Fists.

In an effort to stay connected to the rest of the gang, Hagar grabs onto a rope and sets off into the crowd himself but is brought up short by a stout dwarf, who sends him head over heels to the ground as well.

As the mood quickly turns sour and the crowd begins throwing projectiles at the Black Fists, the gang are caught in the fray. Blows start to fly and a few opportunistic bullies kick Hagar while he's on the ground. Once he pulls himself back to his feet, he sends bodies flying left and right in an attempt to get to Calcey.

While another opportunist finds out that it's not a good idea to punch Peregrine's armor, Delcan gets beaten and robbed by a two-man team who have found a softer target. Hagar shows up just in time to apprehend the slim thug making off with Declan's coin purse, which contains several hundred gold piece.

Using her C*loak of Elvenkind* to evade the crowd, Calcey sprints up to the rest of the party and gets the jump on the other thug who assaulted Declan. Holding on for dear life, she restrains him so Peregrine can go for the haymaker.

At the front of the press, shouting and screaming indicate that someone may be greviously injured. The gang struggle to hold on to their position as bodies flood around them and stampeded away from the Black Fist.

Declan leads the way as the gang sprint away from the Stojanow gate, eventually regrouping down the road. In the distance, the Black Fists appear to have grievously wounded one or several citizens.
