##  Roarke House

Prior to departing Phlan, the gang decides to contact Sahnd Krulek to urge him to consult with the Welcomers. Glevith seems confused by what the gang is offering, but decides he'll meet Sahnd on the 15th of Uktar outside the city at the ruins of Castle Atuke to decide if Sahnd has any useful information.

For his part, Sahnd says only that he won't be back in Phlan anytime soon, as he has "business in the East". He vaguely indicates he'll be the one to contact the gang when the time arises.

The gang debate what the utility of the Cadorna evidence is, and whether it might plunge the Moonsea into a war if carefully (or not carefully) handled.

Returning to Denlor's Tower to meet the Lord Sage and Aya Glenmiir, the gang show the two the area on the second floor that Peregrine and Declan were able to bypass. Aya identifies the trap as a Shrine of Law, but is skeptical of Declan's assertion that the gang didn't plunder the scrolls beyond the door.

As the gang ascend to the spellcasting chamber, they realize that Peregrine is missing. He reappears disguised as an old man, convincingly enough to nearly fool some of the party. Peregrine explains that the disguise is necessary to avoid apprehension by the law, who seek to apprehend him for a crime he evidently couldn't avoid being involved with.

Aya Glenmiir teleports the party to Roarke House, where they meet the coy Henna, of the HAWKs, and Lord Renaer Neverember, master of the house. After Henna has had a chance to size them up, Renaer invites the gang to his study to be briefed on the mission. He is frequently interrupted by friends informing him of the status of the preparations for their journey northward.

When Renaer finishes his briefing, he leads the the gang to their quarters for the evening, a lavishly appointed suite inside Roarke House. The gang debate whether to accept the HAWKs' invitation to visit the Yawning Portal, and make plans to visit a gem merchant to acquire the material components for a *revivify* spell.
