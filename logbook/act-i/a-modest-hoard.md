The gang questions Ellison on his involvement in the cult's plot, learning that he was sent to Phlan to gather information to "wake up" the pool of radiance underneath Valjevo Keep.

On the body of the slain Wyrmling, Peregrine finds a sort of messenger bag containing the pages cut out of the books Ellison took from Aya Glenmiir and Marten Foss. Reading the pages, the gang learns some details about pools of radiance.

While the gang loots Rythnax's small hoard, Hagar tries on the headband stolen from the chest in Mantor's library, finding his intellectual capacity suddenly augmented.

Ellison offers to keep watch as the gang spend the night in Rythnax's lair recovering from their battle wounds.
