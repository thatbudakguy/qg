# Hot on the Trail

Date: June 14, 2020

- After Sergeant Cron Bolver and Lieutenant Aleyd Burral arrive at the crime scene, Aleyd discovers dragon cult tattoos on the half-corpse of the dead thug. The Black Fist take custody of Fulta and the gang return to the Cracked Crown.
- The next morning, Peregrine casts *Locate Object* on the book given to the gang by Marten Foss, discovering that a similar item is in the direction of Mantor’s library, but underground - and on the move.
- Inside Mantor’s library, the gang track the location of the object until it appears to be somewhere underneath the scribes’ hall, where scribe master Cassra meets them.
- Cassra directs the gang to Head Curator Opanrael, who reveals that one Ellison Berenger, who has been working as a scribe, is missing - along with longtime employee Garda Greenleaf.
- Opanrael reluctantly writes a note to Cassra containing an address for items that might lie in the archives beneath the scribes’ hall, warning the gang of the dangers below.
- Deep in the archives, Cassra and the gang discover the corpse of Garda Greenleaf, surrounded by two of the stolen volumes. At that moment, a deafening noise causes the collapse of the surrounding shelves, pinning Cassra to the ground.
- Cassra urges the gang to press on to the subbasement, where they discover a huge room littered with the debris of some ancient fire. The gang is attacked by vengeful specters, most of whom flee when turned by Peregrine’s divine channeling.
- In a secret room off of the basement, the gang discovers a special chest containing magical items with a curious lock that appears to have pierced the skin of whoever used it.
- Finding a hole blown into this room and a destroyed *Horn of Blasting*, the gang follow the trail down a hole leading into the sewers of Phlan with the specters hot on their tail.
