##  Sky Prince

Examining Jeralla's Book, Declan uses the blank pages to set up a simple communication system for the spirit bound within. Through careful questioning, the young sorcerer learns that the spirit in the book did not serve Jeralla willingly, but that it was perhaps given as some sort of gift. The book identifies itself as [Eryn](../Characters/Eryn/%21index.md), a name Declan recognizes as generally used for female Elves.

The remainder of the gang return to Denlor's Tower and accompany Declan up to the second floor to take another look at the magical trap inscribed on the entrance to Denlor's private chambers. Declan again senses a strong aura of abjuration magic in the painting of the Efreeti, this time picking up on some arcane glyphs that could power the trap. The gang clear out to give Peregrine some space to work, but his *dispel magic* fails to have any effect.

Peregrine and Hagar take a moment to store a small arsenal of weapons and items in Denlor's currently unused storage areas on the first floor, and the gang make their first trip to the roof, which is easily accessible through a simple wooden trapdoor. The views of the surrounding area are sweeping, but the gang conclude that someone could gain entrance to the tower this way if they were able to scale the wall.

Declan's *detect magic* reveals that the large bronze door to the lecture hall would be substantially more difficult to enter, as it is protected by arcane wards. The gang take a midday meal of rations artfully dressed up by Calcey in Denlor's restored kitchen. Contacting [Sirge Wintermelt](../Characters/Sirge%20Wintermelt/%21index.md) with a *sending* spell, they learn that [cron-bolver](../../npcs/cron-bolver.md) has been visiting New Phlan recently for reasons unknown.

Peregrine uses his disguise kit to transform Hagar into a foreign tribal warrior, while turning himself into Tommy the courier. Spreading themselves out, the gang make their way into New Phlan to try to pick up Bolver's trail. Hagar is able to contact a rather haughty pigeon using *speak with animals* and convince the bird to fly a reconnaisance mission over New Phlan via *beast sense*.

Calcey visits the Velvet Doublet and concludes that the place is a little too nice to be a regular haunt of the Black Fists, while Peregrine heads down to the dockside area of New Phlan. Near the end of his time with the "Sky Prince", Hagar spots a large group of Knights leaving the docks area of New Phlan headed back to the city, with Bolver potentially among them.

At the same time, Peregrine contrives to accidentally bump into the group, being bowled over by an unamused half-orc wearing Black Fist gear. As his gear spills into the street, Bolver notices Denlor's *headband of intellect*, sensing something is afoot. Examining the item hungrily, the lieutenant demands to know what "Tommy" is doing carrying it.

Thinking quickly, Peregrine explains that the item is a delivery to the [lord-sage](../../npcs/lord-sage.md) himself. Bolver bitterly returns the item and unceremoniously continues on his way, evidently not wishing to upset the balance of power quite yet. As the rest of the gang catch up with Peregrine, Calcey takes off in pursuit of the remaining Fists.

Examining the building from which the troop of Knights emerged, Peregrine concludes that it is currently functioning as a garrison. The unassuming structure might be a warehouse at first glance, but a sharp eye notices details indicating that many Knights are stationed here, perhaps using it as the local station for much of New Phlan.
