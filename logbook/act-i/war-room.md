##  War Room

Hagar sits down with Eiruk Weskur to discuss a variety of enchanting options for the emerald necklace and the gang confer about which item they're interested in requisitioning.

Arriving back from the Hammer and Nail, Renaer complains that a group of adventurers working with the Zhentarim effectively scalped him on rooms for Al-Mandi's attendants. He reveals to the gang that the Zhentarim have agreed to be involved at Kryptgarden, but is unsure of their plan or how much they're really going to help.

Heading out to the field to the west of town, the gang are directed to a large tent. There they meet Ontharr Frume, head of the Elturel chapter of the Order of the Gauntlet, and Leosin Erlanthar, the Harper-aligned monk who mentored Sirge Wintermelt. Together, the group discuss battle plans for the coming day.

Ontharr explains that the Order intercepted a disguised red wizard who was carrying a map to a location outside the hobgoblin fortress where the wizards may be encamped. If the party can attack this location, they may be able to recover intelligence before the assault on the fortress begins.

Venturing further out into the field, the gang come upon the small contingent of Emerald Enclave warriors. Calcey makes a passable attempt at operating a longbow despite her size, earning the respect of the elven archers.

Beside a dying fire, the gang meet Shala, leader of the Dusk Circle of druids from Kryptgarden. Shala explains that King Witchthorn may be receptive to a bargain with the party, if they are able to find his domain and he's willing to be contacted. In that case, his support could be enough to turn the tide of battle.
