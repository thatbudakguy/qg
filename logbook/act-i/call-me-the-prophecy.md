##  Call Me the Prophecy

The gang abandon the flying sword and charge into the fray, meeting the Grey Patriots as they stream across the field from the camp.

Declan blasts the bandits with a dual ice knife, striking several through the heart with cold.

Calcey and Hagar engage Ruse, the Tashalan berserker, as she laughs her way into combat.

Calcey, sneak attack after sneak attack, makes mince meat of the bandits while Hagar takes the final blow on the presumed Berserker Ruse

While the rest of the gang bravely handles the bandits, Declan sneaks off in the suspected direction of the archer

After Peregrine deals the final blow to the last bandit, Declan uses his Maximilian's Earthen Grasp to pin the assailing archer against the stone and crush him to death, grabbing his +1 bow upon his death.

The combat seemingly ended, Calcey manages to glance a fleeting ghost-like figure in the shadow of the distant firelight... Who could it be?
