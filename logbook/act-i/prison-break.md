##  Prison Break

The mysterious elf reveals herself to be Yllivia, a member of the Order of the Gauntlet who had been sent to Phlan to monitor the situation there once martial law was declared.

Yllivia was using Villonah as an informant, capitalizing on the young gnome's tendency to be thrown in the "drunk tank" at Stojanow Gate to gather information on the Black Fists. During one of her more recent episodes, she found evidence that the Fists were collaborating with the Cult of the Dragon to map out the location of a White Dragon's lair.

Yllivia reveals that Villonah still carries this map in a secret location on her body, and shows it to the gang. Taking a moment to calm the young gnome, she departs via her climbing gear and advises the party to contact Marten Foss if they'd like to be in touch.

The gang debates what to do with the remaining prisoners. Attempting to give the Black Fist soldier a taste of his own medicine, Hagar hacks off a tentacle from the beast of the funhouse and tries to lash the soldier with it. Finding this ineffective, Peregrine and Hagar enter the cell and knock him out.

Calcey puts forth the idea of cutting out the man's tongue to ensure he cannot communicate what he has witnessed. Hagar makes quick but bloody work of it and the Fist promptly passes out again.

Outside the cave, Peregrine talks to Rachelle and learns that her son Tim fell prey to the charisma of Sahnd Krulek and left months ago with the original band of Grey Patriots.

Declan tries to get useful information from the insane cultist, but the few bits and pieces that come through don't seem to line up with anything the gang knows about the cult.

Moe the Ferryman arrives to pick up the survivors, but the Black Fist doesn't react when the gang unlocks his cell. Calcey and Hagar escort the two grateful welcomers out to the raft, who decide they won't swim for it after all.

Declan stays behind to let out the cultist, but as soon as the keys turn in the lock, he takes off after Declan. Calcey readies a shot from the raft and plugs him in square in the head as he exits the tunnel, stunning everyone on board the raft.

The survivors of the torture chamber are ferried back to the docks and take their leave. The gang visits Fillistrom to check in on Villonah, then walks back out to Kabel's hill to take a long rest at the Leaky Bucket.

The next morning, an emissary of some of Phlan's noble houses arrives in the form of one mud-spattered man named Braden Yil. He gives the gang a contract for the elimination of both Sahnd Krulek and the Dragonborn leader of the rival bandit gang. The gang tells him they'll need some time to think it over.

The gang visit Marten Foss to ask for more information about what Sahnd Krulek might have been investigating prior to his trial and exile. Foss doesn't know, but does remember that it might have had something to do with events during the time of his hero Ren o' the Blade.
