##  Walharrow's Wrath

Declan convinces Bhevek to leave them on the top floor as the prisoner alarm sounds. Calcey hurriedly breaks Rathene out of her shackles and the gang head downstairs. On the way down, they notice that Captain Walharrow's cell is empty.

At the bottom of the tower, the gang recoil as the door is smashed open by two flying bodies. Readying themselves for combat, they emerge into the entrance hall to find Walharrow - evidently a minotaur - bellowing for blood as he engages two spear-wielding guards.

Ripping a beam out of the ceiling as a makeshift weapon, Walharrow is beset on all sides but manages to gore one of the guards and spook the other into running. He levels Hagar with a mighty blow but Declan manages to light his wooden peg leg on fire, eventually wearing him down until he can be knocked out.

As the gang and Rathene emerge into Grimshackle's courtyard, they come upon a tense hostage scene: a dwarf jailer named Iorg has gone rogue and is holding Ukharim Grimshackle hostage, hoping to break out Rathene. Bhevek instructs his crossbow-wielding men to let the half-orc go, and she and Iorg both make a swift break for the exit.

As the Grimshackle brothers and their guards turn their attention to the fire now raging inside the jail, the gang turn on Rathene and Iorg to stop their escape. *Maximilian's earthen grasp* stops Rathene in her tracks, and Hagar takes her hostage to turn the tables on the patriots.

Outside the courtyard, two grey patriots waiting on horseback join the fray to try to rescue their comrades, having bound Braden Yil. Undeterred by his deathgrip, Iorg rushes at Hagar to get to Rathene and the barbarian cuts her down in retaliation. The gang quickly dispatch Iorg and crush one of the patriots, leaving the other to flee on horseback with the rest of the spooked horses.
