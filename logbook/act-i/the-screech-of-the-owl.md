##  The Screech of the Owl

Emerging from the sea cave, the gang come upon the torchlight of two Grey Patriots, who seem to be scouts posted at the edge of camp. Calcey uses her *cloak of elvenkind* to sneak up for a closer look.

Stealing around behind the large tent, Calcey manages to carefully peek under the canvas and ascertain that no humans are inside. Wedging herself underneath, she comes upon a large table full of maps and papers suggesting the Grey Patriots are orchestrating some mercenary contracts.

Intrigued by the ornate chest at the back of the tent, Calcey handily picks the lock on it only to be assaulted by a sword that comes flying out of the chest swinging at her. Fleeing the tent interior, she goes for broke and stabs the thuggish sentry posted at the front of the tent.

The rest of the gang sprint to join in the fray. Peregrine unleashes a spiritual weapon to fly at the thug, while Hagar makes an incredibly haunting imitation of a screech owl. Revealing that he is Little Erik, the sentry by the tent is sent into a terrified frenzy by the sound.

Declan's fire bolts eventually finish off the beleaguered Calishite, but his torch goes out, plunging the gang into darkness. Another sentry arrives to aid Little Erik but is felled in a single javelin blow by Hagar. Peregrine attempts to dispel the magic animating the sword without success.

As the flying sword continues whirling around in the darkness, the gang turn to their right to behold a horde of torch-wielding bandits sprinting towards them from the Grey Patriot camp, commanded by a foreign voice ordering them to "cut them down!"
