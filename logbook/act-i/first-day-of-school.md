##  First Day of School

Peregrine and Calcey continue making their way through the dungeons at the top of the grillwork stair, discovering a room full of dusty Daoran memorabilia and several others that are evidently disused. After picking several locks in quick succession, Calcey comes upon a room with stairs leading up to another level where faint voices can be heard.

The two debate trying to prevent anyone from discovering the entrance to the underground chamber, but settle for closing the doors and making their way back down the long spiral staircase. Peregrine resolves to contact Sirge to inform him of a possible escape route from the Keep via the illusory wall.

Re-emerging from the Catacombs into the fading light, the gang return to Mantor's Library to confer with the Lord Sage. Stunned at the rediscovery of the Pool of Radiance, he recommends that they seek the counsel of Aya Glenmiir to learn more about whether the pool is still a danger to Phlan. Returning the letter recovered from Thalder's satchel, the Lord Sage also declares that Lord Regent Ector Brahms has pledged to join their trap for the Tears of Virulence.

Aya Glenmiir displays intense interest in the rediscovered pool, pushing the gang to recall details of how it appeared. Based on their description and Declan's *detect magic* spell, Aya is able to conclude that the pool likely no longer functions, a fate which all pools eventually face (though they are rare). Considering how the discovery of the pool fits into the gang's current plans, Aya's counsel is to stay the course and continue with their current trap for Lt. Bolver.

Contacting Sirge, Peregrine is able to learn that the young half-elf was successfully inducted as a knight in front of the Lord Regent on his first day, but not much else. The gang make their way back to Denlor's Tower to rest and prepare for a day of reconnaissance on the morrow.
