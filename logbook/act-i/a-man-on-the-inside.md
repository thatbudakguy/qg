Before leaving Mantor's Library, Declan takes the opportunity to commission research on Khelben Arunsun and Vorgansharax from Cassra Brandywine for the price of 15gp. Cassra promised to deliver results within 3 days.

Recalling that Aleyd Burral had been reassigned to the East Gate, the gang find the dwarf they had previously talked into letting them pass waiting in the shadow of the gate. Declan and Peregrine approach to ask for Aleyd, and she soon appears, asking discreetly if they have a more secure location to talk.

Heading back to the Cracked Crown, the gang take advantage of Jimmy's offer for a free short-term rental and find a room in which they can talk freely with Lt. Burral. Declan shows the soldier the letter recovered from Thalder's satchel implicating Bolver in a plot to put a dragon on the Cinnabar Throne.

Aleyd is distraught, but mentions that she has suspected Cron was involved in something since his sudden promotion to Lieutenant after the untimely deaths of several of his squadmates and commanding officer. At the moment, he is evidently stationed at Stojanow gate, with some level of control over the prisoners within.

The gang listen to Aleyd describe the command structure of the Black Fist and hatch a plan to put a man on the inside. Aleyd will ensure that Sirge Wintermelt is enlisted with the Black Fists, and get him transferred to Cron's unit, where he will attempt to get close to the new Lieutenant. The gang establishes that she is to contact them discreetly via a cairn in front of Denlor's Tower if the need arises.

Aleyd struggles to absorb this information but promises to help however she can. She tells the gang to send Sirge to the Stojanow Gate, where he can secure passage into the Keep and be inducted in the traditional way in front of the Lord Regent, in order to make everything legitimate.
