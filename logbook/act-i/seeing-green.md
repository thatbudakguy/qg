##  Seeing Green

The gang pay the Lord Sage another visit and tell him about the Funhouse prison. He guesses that Sahnd Krulek might have been investigating something to do with Ren's gang and their work for the Cadorna family, characterizing the Sokols as "old money" but the Cadornas as "new money". He also advises them about the trustworthiness of the Order of the Gauntlet and promises to (vaguely) inform the Lord Regent about the prison.

Visiting Stojanow Gate, the gang are told that Aleyd is stationed at the east gate. At the east gate, Declan talks to the dwarf they met before, but fails to persuade him to let them see Aleyd. Peregrine doesn't fare much better.

The gang picks up Calcey's fenced items from Chaab and discusses their options on the contract together over tea at Madame Freona's.

Heading to the Cadorna textile compound, the gang are able to score an early victory in negotiations when Declan's offer of 600gp total is accepted by Braden Yil. The contract is amended to pay 350gp for killing Krulek and 250gp for the Claws of Tiamat leader.

Braden gives the gang a lead: an outlaw was recently apprehended and taken to Grimshackle Jail who might have information on both gangs. The contract is signed and both parties resolve to meet at the Cadorna textile compound the next morning two bells after sunup.
