##  Jeralla Betrayed

The Orc scouts split up to search the Claws of Tiamat camp, with one passing nearby Declan, Hagar, and Calcey on its way to investigate Jeralla's wagon while the others check out the owlbear and the tents.

Catching a glimpse of a magical book, the gang watch as an Orc ventures inside the wagon only to be expelled quickly and rejoin his companions, who leave in short order to return to the warband.

The gang confers with Sirge and Sahnd Krulek about what to do. Sirge is in favor of lighting the signal pyre in the statue's cup to bring the Claws back to camp and force a confrontation, but Sahnd takes charge and orders the party to take up defensive positions and wait for the Orcs to attack. The party agrees to Sahnd's commands, but decide to keep a close eye on him.

Calcey and Declan hide out in the rocks nearby the river while the rest of the party retreat into the cave at the back of the camp to await the arrival of the Orcs. The Claws of Tiamat return shortly, followed by Jeralla, who senses that something is almost upon them. Orcs spring forth from the darkness to attack the sorceress and her minions.

A wounded Jeralla nears the mouth of the cavern, but is stopped by a hulking Orog and his mount who bound into the firelight. A battle ensues where Jeralla is grievously wounded, but at the last moment her Owlbear appears out of the darkness to tear up the Orog and his beast.

When the Owlbear leaps back into the fray, Calcey seizes the moment to take a shot at Jeralla and her crossbow bolt lands true, felling the sorceress in a burst of arcane energy.
