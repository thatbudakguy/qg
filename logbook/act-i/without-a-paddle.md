Shaking off their hangovers, the gang heads into Phlan to meet Fillistrom, who tells them that he's heard about the cliffs of the Stojanow potentially having caves that lead underneath the city.

Visiting the Lord Sage, the gang overhears a conversation between the old half-elf and Aya Glenmiir about a magic item that they are conflicted about.

When they gang enters the office, they tell both scholars about their adventures in the Quivering Forest. In return, they hear tales of a Dragonborn leading a group of kobold bandits feuding with Krulek and his Grey Patriots.

Of the Scale of Tiamat, the Lord Sage relates that they're debating whether to try and destroy the item, but that more time may help them learn more. Its magic isn't similar to that which they've seen before.

The gang make their way down to the docks so Calcey can try schmoozing with the sailors to learn about a secret way into the Lyceum of the Black Lord, but nothing is forthcoming. In the end, Calcey pays an older ferry captain to take them upstream into the city by boat.
