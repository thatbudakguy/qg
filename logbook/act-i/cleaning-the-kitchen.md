##  Cleaning the Kitchen

The gang enter Denlor's Tower, accepting the Lord Sage's hand-drawn map depicting its interior. Proceeding carefully through the ruined kitchen, they make their way into the large lecture hall. Declan notes obvious signs of a struggle.

Proceeding up the stairs to the second floor, the gang come upon the final resting place of Denlor, a large dining room covered in debris. Declan casts *detect magic* and is bombarded by a variety of magical signatures outside the room and on several of its walls. The Lord Sage cautions the gang that all doors except the one to the stairs are trapped.

Continuing up to the third floor, the gang face their first real test: a large door made of hammered bronze and inset with a lion's head sculpture. Declan uses *mage hand* to pull a lever in the lion's mouth, opening the door, but beyond lies only the lecture hall they had previously left.

Each of the gang takes turns operating the door, unable to effect a different result. Eventually, the Lord Sage resigns himself to take the plunge and steps into the room. Once everyone has entered, the doors slowly close, altering themselves to take the form of the simple wood door on the first floor.

On a hunch, Declan reopens the wooden door the gang just came through and discovers it no longer leads to either possible room. Beyond is a marble-floored chamber containing a permanent teleportation circle, the objective the Lord Sage was seeking. Granting them full use of the tower, the Lord Sage tells the gang to meet him here at the end of the month to secure transportation to Waterdeep, and that they will be sent here when the mission concludes.

As the Lord Sage departs, the gang break into Denlor's wine cellar and retrieve a bottle of extremely good wine. Sharing it amongst themselves, they spend some time cleaning up the mess in the kitchen and then bed down for the night in the ruined but serviceable servant's quarters.
