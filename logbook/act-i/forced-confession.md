##  Forced Confession

Taking a moment to gather themselves, the gang tie up the bandit leader and search the barn. Everyone takes a moment to look at the dragon egg, and after a careful investigation with Calcey's spyglass Peregrine is able to conclude it's a clever fake.

The gang stows the dead bodies in the hay and removes the bandit leader to a collapsed building for interrogation. Though initially uncooperative when roused, the half-orc proves much more receptive once Hagar starts snapping toes off.

The bandit leader divulges that he and his crew were hired by the Welcomers - Glevith, in particular - to intercept the egg deal. It quickly becomes apparent he doesn't have much else to offer, so Hagar finishes the interrogation by kneecapping the half-orc and stubbing out a cigar on his face, at which point he again loses consciousness.

The gang make their way to Madame Freona's tea kettle to rendezvous with the Harper. To the astonishment of the patrons and embarrassment of the Harper, Peregrine performs a divine channeling in the interior of the establishment, which effectively announces the party's presence.

The gang returns the dragon egg and is paid in full, along with a potion of greater healing for their troubles. They stop by the Cracked Crown on their way out of town to recover some stored items and then make their way out to Kabel's Hill.
