Setting out in the pre-dawn darkness and cold, the gang quickly find themselves deep within the forbidding gloom of Kryptgarden forest. Navigation is difficult, but they seem to be getting no closer to their intended destination of King Witchthorn's glade.

Hagar is able to speak with a crow that shows strange signs of corruption. The bird haughtily refuses to guide them to the King, instead implying that the forest is no longer under his control. When Hagar attempts to persuade the bird to guide them to the King's Court, it flies away.

Stumbling on through the undergrowth, the gang eventually reach a clearing where Calcey and Declan are able to identify some ruins belonging to the ancient Elven kingdom of Illefarn. As the gang is trying to decipher the writing on the stone, they are alerted to the presence of nearby combatants and take cover.

Several satyrs burst into the clearing in hot pursuit of two injured hobgoblins, whom they soon finish off. When the slaughter is finished, the gang reveal themselves and attempt to negotiate passage to King Witchthorn's domain. The satyrs accept, but clearly plan to trick the gang in some way.

Leading the gang to a mysterious signpost, the satyrs allow Declan to determine that one sign points the way to a princess, but won't explain further. The gang elects to follow them down among the gloomy canyons and arrives at a corrupted brook whose waters and vines are strangling an animated tree and a humanoid form on the riverbank.

Wrestling with the confused and corrupted tree, the gang are battered about until they manage to free the woman bound to it and reroute the poisonous waters that flow about its roots. When both the forest spirit and the treant have come to their senses, the latter explains that Claugilyamatar's influence has corrupted the forest, leading to their imprisonment.

Following the advice of the treant, the gang return to the signpost and write King Witchthorn's name on the blank sign, revealing the way down into the shady glade, a midnight realm shrouded in mystery and magic. There they meet the enigmatic King Witchthorn amid his court of unseelie fey.

When pressed on their reason for intruding on the court, the gang explain they want to know why Witchthorn hasn't checked the influence of Claugilyamatar. Revealing that he was once romantically interested in the dragon, the archfey seems disinterested in the fate of the lands outside his realm until Calcey challenges him to stand up for the forest he claims as his own.

Witchthorn offers the gang a bargain: information about the cult's motives, safe passage into the stronghold, and protection from the dragon in exchange for a favor at a later time of his choosing. Reaching into the minds of each of the mortals at his court, he reads the secrets of their past as though they were a book open in front of him. Calcey boldly accepts the offer, becoming oath-bound to the King.

Learning that the cult seeks an ancient artifact called a Dragon Mask which Claugilyamatar keeps in her hoard, the gang accompany Witchthorn to his reflecting pool, a lake of silver liquid that serves as a portal to an ancient Elven ruin inside the fortress. Entering the pool, they are ejected from an old mirror on the floor of a ruined tower in the heart of the hobgoblin's territory.
