##  Deals Within Deals

Taking advantage of free accommodations at the Leaky Bucket, the gang part ways with Serelis and return to Kabel's Hill. The next morning, everyone wakes up to a delicious home-cooked breakfast prepared by the Brightbells.

Making their way into town, the gang decides to arrive a little early for the planned egg deal. Declan and Peregrine enter the barn and conceal themselves in the hay loft while Calcey and Hagar wait on the lower floor, ready to palm off the Harper's pin.

Shortly thereafter, a shady-looking elf and some human guards arrive to complete the deal. The elf opens a hide backpack to reveal what looks like a real blue dragon egg, asking Hagar to throw the payment over. After a moment, she realizes something is off: Hagar is too young, and he doesn't have a broken tusk like the buyer is supposed to.

Capitalizing on the moment of uncertainty, Calcey leaps into combat. The elf drops the egg and sprints out of the barn, with the halfling rogue in hot pursuit. In the chaos, Calcey sticks the pin to the fleeing Elf's cloak. Her guards put up a token fight but turn tail as soon as they can see there's no point in sticking around. The fight is over before it's begun.

The gang doesn't have a moment to rest on their laurels, however. A half-orc captain bashes in a secret door to the back of the barn, yelling for his men to spring a trap. Two thugs who had been patiently concealed in the hayloft throw a net over Hagar, as two more rush into the building and engage the gang in combat, swarming Declan.

In a brutal slugfest, the gang dispatch the thugs one-by-one as the captain looks on, smoking his cigar. As the tide begins to turn, he wades into battle against Hagar, tossing out insults along the way. When he can see there's no point fighting anymore, he too attempts to flee but is frozen in his tracks by Peregrine's *command* spell and wrapped up in *Maximilian's earthen grasp.* The gang promptly knocks him out.
