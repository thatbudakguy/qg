##  Highharvesttide

Examing the pin given to the gang by the Harper, Declan casts *Detect Magic* and concludes it does indeed radiate divination magic.

When the gang returns to the Cracked Crown, Calcey takes a closer look at the "diamonds" with her magnifying glass and concludes they'll get the job done but might not stand up to closer scrutiny.

The gang walks to the outskirts of Phlan to case the area of the deal. It appears to be an abandoned barn with a loft containing little excepted rusted farm tools and hay. Peregrine ensures that no one else is snooping around.

While Calcey starts the festivities early with a couple of buckets from the Cracked Crown, Hagar visits Cockburn's Grocery for a wardrobe update. Upon being politely asked not to carry open beverages in the store, he quaffs (almost) an entire bucket in one go.

Hagar settles on a tight-fitting vest embroidered with a dragon pattern along with leather breeches and waterproof gaiters: an expensive outfit that shows off his flair for style.

The gang heads out to Kabel's Hill to join in the Highharvesttide festivities with the Moss family. There they find a veritable feast laid out on simple tables in the Peat fields by the Mosses and their hired farm labor.

Haldred Moss invites the gang down to the Leaky Bucket, a local watering hole, to carry on with the night's festivities (and most of them don't need convincing). As dinner wraps up, a light rain begins to fall.

As the gang approach the Leaky Bucket, it becomes clear that there is some kind of altercation brewing inside. When the doors are opened, they reveal a scene of total chaos, with a halfling couple desperately trying to keep the peace. All eyes are on the gang.
