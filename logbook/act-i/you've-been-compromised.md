##  You've Been Compromised

Declan and Hagar join in the firefighting efforts, managing to largely extinguish the blaze between the two of them and the rest of the Grimshackle Jail staff.

In return, the Grimshackles offer the gang Walharrow, if they're interested in taking him out on a rickety wagon that lives in the keep's ruined stable. Calcey and Hagar hogtie the huge pirate and strap him to the cart using Peregrine's rope.

Peregrine takes Rathene outside the keep and dons the cloak of the slain Grey Patriot. Shaking her awake, he pretends they've escaped the keep and demands she somehow prove she hasn't been compromised. To prove her authenticity, Rathene reveals that the patriots often enter the caves underneath King's Pyre from the ocean using their longship. Peregrine then knocks her out again.

Freed from his bondage, Braden offers to charter the gang a ship if they intend to approach from the sea. They set off with Hagar and Peregrine pulling one half of the cart each. After the first hour, Hagar starts to tire. Walharrow awakes, but Calcey swiftly beats him unconscious again.

The gang reach Phlan, but Hagar is severely exhausted. the Black Fist send for a contingent and Aleyd Burral and Cron Bolver show up to take a look at Walharrow. Bolver negotiates a price of 300gp for the minotaur with Declan, and everyone returns to the Stojanow gate so the gang can be paid. Braden takes his leave and promises to meet the gang in the morning, and the rest return to the Leaky Bucket to get some rest.
