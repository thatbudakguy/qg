##  Quid Pro Quo

Returning to the city after a rousing country breakfast, the gang find Braden Yil at the Cadorna compound dressed in his best travel attire and ready to set out headed North.

Together, the group makes the muddy trek up the Stojanow river to Grimshackle jail. The day is foggy, dampening the spirits and slowing progress to a crawl. The journey takes over three hours.

At the dangerously run-down Grimshackle Jail building, the gang bargains for 20 minutes worth of face time with the Grey Patriot prisoner. They are let into the overgrown courtyard of the building by a miserly halfling by the name of Bhevek.

Inside the keep, the gang greeted by a pair of crossbow-wielding thugs and Ukharim, the other Grimshackle brother. After fetching a lantern, Bhevek leads the gang up the tightly wound spiral staircase to the top of the rickety keep.

On the way up to the top, the gang pause for a moment to take in a heavily secured cell that is bound by chain. Bhevek explains that a notorious moonsea pirate named Captain Walharrow is kept prisoner here, at tremendous risk to his staff.

At the top of the keep, the gang meets Rathene Fel, the half-orc bandit who was captured in the raid on the Sokol caravan. She appears to be in rough shape, and by Declan's judge fairly willing to exact revenge on her compatriots, who have made no attempt to rescue her as of yet.

Rathene drives a hard bargain, pushing the gang to cough up 30gp towards hot meals for her. In exchange, they learn about Krulek's plan to hammer out a truce between the Grey Patriots and Claws of Tiamat at the gang's old hideout of King's Pyre.

As visitation hours expire, the gang is alerted by the sound of bells and smell of smoke. A terror-stricken Bhevek fears that the prisoner alarm is sounding because Walharrow has somehow broken loose.
