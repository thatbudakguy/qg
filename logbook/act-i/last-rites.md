##  Last Rites

As the Leaky Bucket crowd returns to normalcy, the Gang learns from its halfling proprietors the Brightbells that the hubbub is tied to the disappearance of Halvin Graingle over two tendays ago, bound for the Quivering Forest.

Fearing Halvin had violated the ancient truce between the fey of the Quivering Forest and the people of Phlan and its surroundings, the people of Kabel's Hill apparently resolved to send in a search party after him about a tenday ago. Evidently none of them have returned.

As the gang mull over the situation, Hupe Brightbell passes around a hat and collects the all the cash the poor farmers can muster to offer to the gang to look into the situation. It's plain that the folk of Kabel's Hill are desperate, and the gang offers to investigate in exchange for free lodging and drink at the Leaky Bucket in lieu of payment.

The scene inside the Leaky Bucket is interrupted by a loud scream and the entrance of an obviously distressed young woman, prompting a mass exodus to the town center. There the gang finds a man hanging from a signpost with blood pouring from his excised eyeballs and tongue. The victim has been impaled with a foot-long pin made of bone. Nailed to him by the pin is a note addressed to the forest fey from the townspeople of Kabel's Hill.

Determining that the man somehow isn't yet deceased, Peregrine attempts to gingerly bring him off the pole and remove the pin. Despite the effects of a *guidance* spell, the operation succeeds but the patient doesn't make it. He offers some final holy words and the body is wrapped in wool and carried off to be buried.

Examining the bone pin that had impaled the man, Declan casts *detect magic* and is surprised to learn that it radiates divination magic - just like the pin given to the gang by the Harper, and just like the effigy of Declan found in the Quivering Forest. The gang hurriedly ditches these scrying focuses in the Leaky Bucket, afraid their conversations are bugged.

On the advice of Grinna Brightbell, the gang sets out in the dark and rain to seek the counsel of the ranger Serelis Greenleaf. When they make it to Serelis's simple cabin, he immediately recognizes the danger the town is in: the hag Jeny Greenteeth is aware that the pact with the fey has been broken. Declan convinces Serelis that the gang will be going into the Quivering Forest with or without his help, and Serelis reluctantly agrees to serve as a guide.

With Serelis in tow, the gang set out once more for Kabel's Hill to investigate the dwelling of Halvin Graingle. In the kitchen of Halvin's simple home, the ranger's sharp eyes discover a hidden cupboard containing a journal that tells the whole story. Halvin is no eccentric, but a Cult of the Dragon agent sent to convince the fey of the Quivering Forest to abandon their pact and aid the cult in seizing Phlan.

In the barn behind Halvin's house, the gang discovers evidence leading them to a field where Pipyap, Halvin's imp familiar, has been gorging himself on local cows. Pipyap greets the gang cheerfully, asking if they know where Halvin has gone to. The imp balks at the suggestion of traveling into the forest, fearing the wrath of a Hag, but wonders when he will meet his master again.
