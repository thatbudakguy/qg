##  Tight and Fit

The gang return to the city to seek out Braden Yil at the Cadorna textile compound, learning that he has ventured down to the docks and can be found at the Laughing Goblin. There they find him breakfasting with Walteph Wiley, the captain of the cog *Kite*, whom Braden is engaging to carry the gang to King's Pyre.

Braden agrees to reimburse the gang for the bribing of the Grimshackle Jailers and purchase of the scroll of *feather fall*, but is reluctant to fund the scroll of *identify*. The group venture out into the bay of Phlan to examine the *Kite* and its crew of six, currently sitting at anchor off Thorn Island.

Finding nothing wanting on the ship, the gang resolve to take care of their pre-departure shopping with Braden in tow. Still reeling from his exertion the previous day, Hagar is shown to his cabin and promptly falls asleep.

At Aya Glenmiir's shop, Calcey notices a heavily-armored stranger who seems to be keeping a close eye on the gang and Braden. Aya reveals that he is Dyrn, the ward of the young nobleman Devon Nanther of Melvaunt, who has recently traveled to Phlan to study with Aya.

When she gets a spare moment, Aya reveals to the gang that she and the Lord Sage believe the Scale of Tiamat recovered from the Temple of the Scale to be authentic. It's unclear what this might mean for the usage of the item, but one thing is for certain: it can't fall into the hands of the cult. Their research is ongoing.

Aya discreetly reveals that she is associated with the Harpers, and asks if the gang are willing to collaborate with the intelligence-gathering society. She gives Peregrine a harp pin in case the gang's allegiance is questioned.

At Valhingen graveyard, the gang retrieve their scroll of *identify* and generously fund the funeral rites of a nameless soldier who died by choking on his food. Braden rather rudely inquires after the soldier's build, but finds he's willing to fund the purchase of the scroll after hearing the danger that the gang put themselves in in the graveyard.

Doomguide Yovir Glandon tells the gang that he investigated the Welltran crypt himself after the gang cleared it out, and came away perplexed - it appears that Xandria was not interred quite as early as it was thought by the Kelemvorites. Instead, the tomb may date to the 14th century, a tumultuous time in the history of Phlan when heroes saved the city more than once.

Yovir gleaned from Brother Keefe that it was possible the Welcomers intended to use the Welltran crypt as a secret entrance to the graveyard. To prevent further defilement of the tomb, he sealed it on exiting. Of the necromantic potion, he saw no trace.

Returning to the *Kite*, the gang part ways with Braden and cast off for King's Pyre. After a relatively uneventful 16-hour journey, the gang sight the unmistakable statue that gives the landmark its name early in the afternoon on their second day of travel.
