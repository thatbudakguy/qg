Awaking after another night spent in the forest, the party struggle to orient themselves. After multiple attempts to splice rope and reaffix it to the grappling hook, the gang abandons hope for scaling a tree and decides to take their chances with the map. Hagar and Calcey take the lead as the group makes up for lost time.

After a full day of travel, the night passes relatively without incident, save for a slight misunderstanding about watch timings between Amer and Artin. The gang awakes ready to make for Kabel's Hill.

Over the course of the following day the group makes great progress, and Peregrine is certain that the overall light level is increasing as the forest canopy thins out. The gang makes camp one final time.

The brothers manage to mess up their watch order again, but otherwise everyone awakes unharmed. In their final day, the group exits the quivering forest north of Kabel's Hill and follows the Stojanow south to the outskirts of town.

Taking a moment to get their story straight, the gang decide to pay Serelis a visit. They part ways with Amer and Artin. Serelis appears taciturn and asks the gang to leave, clearly unhappy with the outcome of their expedition.

Returning to the leaky bucket, the gang tell their story to the Brightbells. Despite the events that transpired at Greenhall, the halflings are overwhelmed with gratitude. Re-examining Jeny's scrying focuses, Declan decides to keep the effigy of himself.

The gang return to Phlan in the afternoon to do some shopping, visiting the Grocer, Armorer, and Apothecary. Calcey pays a visit to Chaab the fence, and Declan takes the swirling globe he found in Jeny's hut to be appraised by Aya Glenmiir.

Aya greets the group warmly, but is able to swiftly determine that the globe is merely a trinket. As they leave the wizard's study, they notice a gathering mob heading in the direction of Valjevo castle against the wind and rain.

Borrowing a broadsheet from one of the commoners, Declan discovers that a wanted notice has been put out for one Sahnd Krulek, leader of the outlaw gang the Grey Patriots. As the gang nears the Stojanow Gate, a mob has assembled in front of a platoon of Black Fists.

Stealing amongst the crowd, Calcey hears angry altercations about the lack of trade goods in the city and the incompetence of the fists. When a burly man demands to know why the Fists haven't reigned in their wayward compatriots, things quickly devolve into a full-blown riot.
