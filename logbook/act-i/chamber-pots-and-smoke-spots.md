##  Chamber Pots and Smoke Spots

In the morning, Peregrine pays the Lord Sage a visit to find out why he was unable to find the Scale of Tiamat using *locate object*. The old half-elf reassures the cleric that his secret storage area is warded against magical discovery, evidently one of the few works of magic he was able to undertake on his own.

Declan and Calcey pay another visit to Lt. Aleyd Burral, returning to the Cracked Crown for some privacy. The knight explains what she knows of Bolver's schedule and suggests that both parties adopt the cairn as a signal to meet at the Cracked Crown, so that the gang doesn't need to continue to come looking for her at the East Gate.

Hagar finds a crow gorging itself on garbage that is nevertheless willing to perform a reconnaissance flight on the Stojanow Gate. Through the beast's eyes, he catches a glimpse of a woman behind bars on the second floor of the gate, and other empty spaces that could be prison cells.

Heading out to Kabel's Hill to inquire after the crew of the *Seagull's Caw*, Hagar finds young captain Bramblebottom and his elderly grandfather taking their breakfast at the Leaky Bucket. Calvin explains that the escapees from the Claws of Tiamat decided to have the longship berthed for the winter and to meet up in the spring to set out on the Moonsea together.

Everyone meets back up at Aya Glenmiir's shop to contact Sirge. The young Harper promises to make his move and show the cult amulet to Bolver after lunch that day. The gang debate how best to surveil Bolver, if he plans to leave the safety of the gate.

Calcey uses her *cloak of elvenkind* to stay hidden while observing members of Bolver's unit hearing petitioners at the gate. After a shift change, Bolver works the desk for some time and eventually leaves the gate headed west, with Sgt. Yerk in tow.

Near the Cadorna textile compound, Calcey witnesses Bolver commiserating with a dwarf wearing the rank of Sergeant, and the two share a pipe. The dwarf clearly holds a grudge against those who outlawed the worship of Bane, and wishes revenge on whoever cleared out the secret prison underneath the remains of the Lyceum.

Bolver finishes his conversations and moves back through Podol Plaza, stopping briefly to chat with a surprised Declan and Hagar. Calcey is forced to give up the trail when Bolver exits through the East Gate, but he reappears a short time later and returns to the Stojanow gate. The gang travel to the rear of Valjevo castle to collect Peregrine, who had been watching the rear exit.

As the gang make their way through New Phlan in the direction of Valhingen Graveyard, they stop briefly at the abandoned house where they discovered evidence implicating the Cadorna family. The property is now a burnt ruin. They resolve to question Bryce Vang about how this came to be.
