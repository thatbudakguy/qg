The gang pay a visit to the Lord Sage to seek counsel. Asking about the readiness of the Black Fist to defend the city, they learn that he is confident of their abilities in battle, but perhaps not convinced their loyalties are all in the right place.

On the plans of the cult, the Lord Sage suspects that the lull in activity may signal that the cult is responding to having their plans repeatedly foiled by the gang - and that they are now planning something longer-term, for which the hammer may yet fall.

When the gang mention the Scale of Tiamat, the Lord Sage becomes noticeably somber. He explains that, though the scale likely conveys some benefits as a shield, its function as a piece of the body of a god means that it will grow in power as Tiamat comes to reclaim it, and that she likely knows its location at all times.

The Lord Sage is also able to offer some information about Claugilyamatar, the ancient and wily green dragon who rules over the forest of Kryptgarden. "Old Gnawbones", as she is known, is fond of working through intermediaries and using scrying magic to get the upper hand on her foes. If the gang decide to go to Kryptgarden, they should expect to be watched at some point.

About Krulek's puzzle, the Lord Sage recommends starting simple: perhaps Krulek's clues had something to do with geographic locations, something he hoped it would be simple for the gang to discover using only a map.

Closing on a more mischevious note, the Lord Sage asks the gang to meet him at Kutos' well that night and ensure they are not followed.

The gang pay a visit to Fillistrom Wunderkundoodle and learn that their rescue of the gnome's daughter has enabled him to work on new tinctures to offer. He appears in good health and spirit, and sells them most of the contents of his shop.
