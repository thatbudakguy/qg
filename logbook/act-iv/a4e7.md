peregrine's prison pen pal

rushing, full stojanow river. budding wildflowers. fragrant air.
H send Ullo learn about Dwarven mining paths, decides to scout ahead
commune shows him a path hewn through the rock, an old dwarven trail
declan finds old mine shaft, calcey goes down and finds minecart tracks
hagar goes down and conjures totem spirit, but gets vision where uzgat receives the crystal
declan becomes a bat and sees that the rails keep going
decide to assemble a minecart and go down the tracks
P assembles an extremely janky minecart
D & P become bats inside the cart
go into switchyard, calcey shoot the switch
go down into output, P bat find council table with map of the dragonspines
D goes into outfitting room with hooks and then something (umber hulk) blasts out from wall
