# The Cryptolab

Date: September 20, 2020

- The gang pay a visit to Aya Glenmiir to commission a scroll of *feather fall,* for which they pay 50gp. Aya promises to scribe it by the next morning.
- Heading to Valhingen graveyard to rendezvous with the Kelemvorites, the gang meets Yovir Glandon for the first time in several tendays. They retrieve the catacombs map they found on the invaders who were digging a tunnel under Valjevo keep.
- Yovir gives the gang an overview of the spellcasting services the temple offers, but promises to put in a little extra effort if they will help out with an issue that's facing one of his staff. Simon introduces Brother Keefe, the master of interment at Valhingen.
- Brother Keefe explains his problem: one of Valhingen's oldest "residents", Xandria Welltran, is rumored to have been a polymorphed green dragon. The gang agrees to accompany Keefe to the Welltran crypt to help put the rumor to rest.
- When the gang approach the building, Peregrine is able to relate its strange elemental iconography to the puzzles they encountered at the Temple of the Scale, which compared chromatic dragons to the elements of nature.
- Inside the crypt, Keefe and the gang find the Welltran sarcophagus full of a strange jumble of human and non-human bones. Suddenly, the crypt's door begins to close, trapping everyone inside as poisonous gas begins to seep out of somewhere inside the building.
- The gang quickly deactivates the crypt's security features using the gems left in the sarcophagus, revealing a secret entrance. Brother Keefe bows out of the investigation, having had enough for one day.
- Down the spiral staircase, the gang finds a throne room with three half-dragon skeletons standing at attention. Declan deftly relieves them of their swords using *mage hand*, but is pricked by a poison needle trap when he investigates the throne itself.
- Moving further down the stairs, the gang discover a clandestine laboratory full of texts on powerful dragon-focused necromancy. Nearby a foul-looking mixture in a clay pot is a [Note for Raaxil in Welltran Crypt](../Handouts/%E2%9C%89%EF%B8%8F%20Note%20for%20Raaxil%20in%20Welltran%20Crypt.md).
- At the bottom of the crypt is a large throne room-like chamber containing several inert, heavily modified humanoid bodies. When Peregrine investigates further, arcane glyphs etched into each wall flare to life and reanimate the bodies with necromantic energy.
