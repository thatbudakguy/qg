# Scrolls and Secrets

Date: June 7, 2020

- The party visits and questions Aya Glenmiir, learning that the thief also stole some of her spell scrolls and a *Horn of Blasting*.
- The party visits and questions Marten Foss, who describes the exploits of Ren o’ the Blade chronicled in his memoirs, including his defeat of Tyranthraxus at the Pool of Radiance underneath Valjevo Castle.
- Hagar spars with Marten Foss’s daughter Vera but is unable to best her in the arena. Impressed, Marten gives the party a book with a similar binding to the memoirs.
- The party visits Agin Lamarck and discovers his laughable excuse for a defense against thieves. When pressed, Lamarck admits the truth: his ancestor laid claim to the Lamarck name through forgery in the *Lords and Lineages of Phlan*.
- Lamarck offers the party an additional 50gp to return the book directly to him and keep the secret safe.
