Dear Quarantine Gang,

You've proved most useful to me, and our agreement is nearly complete. At Skyreach Castle you performed admirably in taking care of Rezmir the Black, though it seems you also managed to deal a heavy blow to our Thayan friends in red robes. Yet you did not return to me the one thing you know I desire. I find you too blunt an instrument to justify your continued acting on my behalf, and so I propose a deal.

If you're reading this, you know what I have, and since you hid it, you know how important it is. You have something that is equally important to me. Severin would never forgive me if he knew I intended to let slip a relic of Tiamat, but make no mistake: I intend to deal fairly with you. All I want, and all I have wanted from the beginning, is this: the rank of Wyrmspeaker, and my own dragon mask.

I'll await your arrival at my hunting lodge outside Parnast. Do take care to announce your coming so that we can avoid another nasty situation with Trepsin and the guard drakes. In any case, I'll be watching.

Talis the White
