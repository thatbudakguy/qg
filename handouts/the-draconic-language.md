# The Draconic Language

The language of dragons is one of the oldest forms of communication. According to the wyrms, it is second only to the languages of the outsiders, and all mortal tongues are descended from it. Its script was likely created long after its spoken form was standardized, as dragons have less need to write than other races. Some scholars believe Draconic script might have been influenced by Dwarven runes, but the wise don’t express this opinion within hearing of a dragon.

Many reptilian races use crude versions of Draconic, including lizardfolk and troglodytes. It is likely that these races were once taught or enslaved by dragons, and it is even possible that they took Draconic for their own simply to make a claim to common ancestry. The Draconic script is also used when a written form is needed for the elemental languages of Auran and Ignan. Despite this commonality, it is no easier for someone who knows Draconic to learn the languages of air and fire creatures.

Slight variations exist in the dialect of Draconic that is used by the various kinds of chromatic dragons. These differences are similar to regional accents. They form no impediment to understanding, but they are sufficiently obvious for a native speaker to know whether someone learned to speak Draconic from a red or green dragon. The various metallic dragons all have similar accents, but the chromatic dragons each have their own slight differences in pronunciation. In general, Draconic has not changed significantly for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.

Draconic sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants. It includes sounds that humans generally describe as hissing (sj, ss, and sv) as well as a noise that sounds a great deal like a beast clearing its throat (ach).

Words that modify other words can be placed before or after the word they modify. The most important modifier is always placed before, and it might be placed directly after as well if additional emphasis on the modifier is desired. A speaker of Draconic who wanted to say a big, black, evil dragon was approaching, but wanted the fact that it was evil more than anything else might say, “Malsvir darastrix turalisj vutha gethrisj leirith” or even “Malsvir darastrix turalisj vutha malsvir gethrisj leirith.”

Most Draconic words have emphasis placed on the first syllable. Important ideas are emphasized in spoken Draconic by stressing the beginning and end of the word. In the written form, important words are marked with a special symbol of six lines radiating outward, similar to an asterisk (\*). This device is most often used by dragons when referring to themselves. The dragon Karajix would pronounce his name KA-raj-IX, and it would be written \*Karajix\*. This emphasis is also sometimes used when commanding, threatening, warning, or making a point.

Draconic has no specific word for “my” or “mine,” instead using several prefixes depending on the exact meaning. A physical object claimed as a possession by a dragon speaker would begin with “veth” or “vethi,” an individual with a relationship to the dragon (such as a friend or relative) begins with “er” or “ethe,” and all other forms of possessiveness are represented by putting “ar” or “ari” before a word. Thus for a dragon to say “my sword” or “the sword is mine” he need only say “vethicaex,” and “arirlym” translates as “my enemy.” When indicating possession by another, combine the name of the possessor with the object possessed into a single word that starts with “ar” or “ari.”
