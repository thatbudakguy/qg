# Timeline

1375 DR: Senior Cloak Thurndan Tallwand, of Mulmaster's Brotherhood of the Cloak, imprisons High Blade Selfaril Mondar in a soulgem in the pommel of a sword so that his twin brother Rassendyll might rule in his place. 

1470 DR: Curran Sunhearth, Chosen of Tymora (unbeknownst to him), fakes his own death to avoid capture by agents of Thay in Mulmaster. His pregnant wife Ella Sunhearth leaves Mulmaster for the sleepy village of Elmwood.

1471 DR: Calcey Sunhearth is born to Ella in Elmwood. The child proves an able farmhand, lending her dexterity and willpower to many of Elmwood's families in exchange for a little coin.

1487 DR: Calcey learns to pick a lock from her neighbor Cere, at age 16. The same night, she steals from Cere's mother. In short order, Elmwood falls victim to a rash of petty thefts perpetrated by the duo.

1488 DR: Calcey is caught stealing by her mother, who marches her off to constable Jorgadaul. The wily old dwarf makes a compromise: Calcey must be exiled to keep the peace in the community, but she will be in good hands in nearby Mulmaster with Jorgadaul's old adventuring companion Alamarayne Moonray at the temple of Selune. Calcey leaves for Mulmaster the next morning.

1489 DR: Calcey abandons her duties at the temple of Selune, beginning to make a name for herself on the streets of Mulmaster. She initially finds work on the docks, blending in with the grizzled sailors and fishermen who ply the shores of the Eastern moonsea.

1500 DR: Calcey has made a name for herself as "Danger's Blade", the daring thief who takes from Mulmaster's richest when they least expect it. She piles success upon success, growing bolder with each job.

1505 DR: Calcey successfully infiltrates a party being held by the Blades in the Palace of Revels, eventually going home with one of them in order to rob him. When the noble awakes at an inopportune time, Calcey is forced to strangle him to death in his own home. Soon, the heat is turned up as agents of the Lord's Alliance crawl over the city looking for her.

1506 DR: Thinking to make one final show of force, Calcey successfully infiltrates the tower of Thurndan Tallwand and steals his famous Elven longsword with the aid of a jealous rival. When Calcey retrieves the sword, she finds that it begins telling her the story of how its soul was imprisoned 125 years before.

1507 DR: Calcey is cornered by the Brotherhood of the Cloak and imprisoned by Thurndan Tallwand for the theft of his property. Knowing that killing Calcey would simply double her fame, Thurndan opts to take the one thing she has to give him: her youth. He magically ages her 75 years and sets her free to live out her twilight years in sorrow. During her "year of rain", Calcey encounters her father in a tavern, but doesn't retain this memory due to her stupor.

1508 DR: Calcey comes to her senses on the deck of a ship bound for Melvaunt, for unknown reasons. Upon arriving in Melvaunt, she find the city fiercely guarded by a variety of mercenary forces armed by the powerful and wealthy Ironhanded nobility. Judging the climate too risky in which to operate, she hears that Phlan has just entered martial law and goods are scarce, creating a fertile climate for smugglers. In Mulmaster, Curran is finally captured by the agents of Thay.

1509 DR: Calcey arrives in Phlan, seeking to establish a new name for herself - perhaps as a smuggler.
