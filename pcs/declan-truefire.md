# History

Grew up in Semberholme, a quiet area of densely wooded hills that formed one of the four ancient communities of the great Elven kingdom of Cormanthyr. Raised by a tight-knit, self-reliant agricultural cult of wood giants who worshipped Chauntea, the goddess of life and bounty. Parents unknown; was raised believing that he simply magically appeared. Venerated as a symbol of Chauntea's thanks to her faithful and treated as the answer to the cult's long years of prayer; birth coincided with many years of plenty. Left cult at age 22 when he discovered the truth was a little less magical.

# Appearance

Characteristically willowy young half-elven male. Very pale skin, green eyes, shoulder-length blonde hair. Look in eyes that might be described as a "twinkle" or as "brooding" depending on who's interested. High cheekbones and prominent chin, with an understated kind of nobility. An inviting face that easily gets strangers at the tavern talking. Someone you feel you can open up to, but you're not sure why. Reminds you of a (blonde) Tom Holland.

# Talents

Skilled impersonator who can mimic others easily, especially when highlighting their flaws for comic effect. Expert at drumming up sympathy from others, particularly by portraying himself or others as downtrodden folk in need of mercy. Can recite from memory many names and tales from the golden ages of Elven civilization in Faerun, thousands of years before his birth. Has a broad but shallow grasp of both arcane and divine magic, as the giants maintained that his abilities were both a divine gift and a personal talent.

# Mannerisms

Sometimes uses flowery speech or long words, even mispronouncing words he's read but has never heard another person speak aloud. Enunciates very clearly and has a fairly high voice, which can sound by turns inspiring or reedy and irritating. Tends toward smooth-talking when interacting with anyone who can give him something he wants. Quickly becomes sullen when not being entertained by the presence of anyone interesting.

# Interactions

Naturally inspires his friends and happily serves as the "face" who can represent their best interests, but sometimes finds it difficult to gloss over their flaws. Is selective with his graces, often choosing to establish bonds with others who strike him as outsiders. Speaks in the somewhat highborn register of someone who has read too many old books, which may raise eyebrows among the common folk but opens doors with merchants and nobles. Has a tendency to attribute perhaps more intelligence and cunning to simple foes than they really deserve, and may hesitate when swift violence is called for.

# Ideals

Clings to the idea that he was placed in the world to serve some higher purpose, even if he was lied to about what that purpose is. Confident in his arcane talents, which have been a fundamental part of his life and personality as far back as he can remember. Believes wholeheartedly that true greatness, like that displayed by the adventurers and scholar-kings of bygone days, can turn the tide of any battle and save the world from any enemy. Delights in writing his own story and inspiring others along the way.

# Bonds

Turned his back on the only family he had. Desperate for a community into which he can fit on his own terms. Has convinced himself he no longer feels for the giants who served as his surrogate parents, even if those emotional wounds are not fully closed. Has not moved past the pain of losing contact with the wood elves who were his sometime relatives and playmates, and refuses to reckon with this trauma.

# Flaws

Trust issues, including with his newfound friends and adventuring companions. Prone to rash decisions in the name of adventure and the exercise of personal freedom. Can be judgmental of those who display obvious weaknesses or are simply uninteresting, as they are clearly relegated to a place of little importance in his story. Without the calm afforded by his arcane focus, can quickly be overcome by anxiety or anger stemming from the magic that courses through his body at all times.
