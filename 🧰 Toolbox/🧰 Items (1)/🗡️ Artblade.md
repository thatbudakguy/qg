Ary’Faern’Kerym: The Artblade “Noble Sorcerer’s Sword”

+4 longsword, +2 AC deflection bonus, Dispel Magic 3/day, Detect Magic at will.

This sword appears to be a long sword forged from solid darkness, feeling as solid as stone but as slick as oil. When drawn, the Artblade crackles like lightning, when swung it emits a sharp buzzing sound similar to an angry bee, the sound can be muted at the wielder’s will. When struck against objects or weapons, the blade’s clash is utterly silent. Along the razor-sharp, beveled edge of the blade glows a crimson beam of energy that encloses the darkness.

Elfblades bond with their wielders during the blade-rite. If a wielder is accepted the blade will maintain a magical link to it’s wielder, allowing it to be summoned directly to the wielder’s hand despite distance or physical barriers, provided both elf and blade are on the same plane. Magical protections might interfere with this ability.

The Artblade is an intelligent weapon that is neutral good, has an Int of 16 and a Cha and Wisdom of 13. It can speak telepathically or audibly in elvish. It has an ego of 20. Should the wielder ever change alignment, race or sex without the elfblade’s consent or knowledge it imposes a blade-rite test on the wielder. Alternately it can inflict random bursts of pain (1d4) upon the wielder or it can attempt to dominate the wielder.

The Artblade allows it’s wielder to cast a spell through the blade (no material components needed for most spells), somatic components are cast via slashes and verbal through the humming of the blade. Touch attacks can be delivered through the blade. If Evocation spells are cast through the blade then they act as if cast by a caster 1 level higher.

Once attuned to the wielder, the Artblade will reduce the physical age of the wielder by 1d6x100 years (no loss of mental bonuses, but physical negatives if any are removed). An elf is never reduced to less then the first year of adulthood.

Blade-Rite:

The blade-rite is invoked whenever a new wielder is chosen for an elfblade. The blade-rite is normally conducted by elven high-mages in secret rituals. The blade-heir is put through a test of talent, mind and heart. These tests occur within the mind of the tested elf, though all effects are suffered as if the tests were real; only the tested elf and the high mages are privy to the scene of the test. If the tests are passed, he rises to the station of Coronal, Arms-Major or Spell-Major as befits the elfblade.

Whenever a wielder dies, an elfblade is rendered inert and non-magical until drawn in a blade-rite or drawn at a place of power. If an elfblade is stolen, any who attempt to hold it unsheathed immediately suffer the penalties of failing the blade-rite as are any N’Tel’Quess (non-elves) that dare to wield the blade. They are struck dead (Con save DC 17 or 4d6 hp of permanent hp damage).
