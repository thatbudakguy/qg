## the choice/subclasses

declan - bladesinger vs chosen

hagar - ? vs warlock (magnar subsumed by rillifane but alive; seeks patron)

calcey - thief vs paladin?

connecting each of the PCs with a god or entity involved in a greater struggle:

- Declan: Mystra (or Chauntea?)
- Calcey: ? An evil entity, who grooms Calcey to turn on the party at a crucial moment? Asmodeus himself?
- Peregrine: Bahamut, Null?
- Hagar: Magnar

using the events of the Dragonfall War in -30,000 DR

- Dragon general Nagamat worked for Tiamat in the Time of Dragons & Draco holy wars
- His death sparked the Dragonfall War between followers of Bahamut and Tiamat
- Cult of the Dragon has found his body and is trying to reanimate him as a dracolich

using the Pools of Radiance or disturbances in the Weave as the focus of the cult

- Declan is the newest Chosen of Mystra, or the son/daughter of one of them
- Mystra is ashamed of the damage that her chosen Sammaster wrought upon the world, and created Declan to stop his cult from further wreaking havoc using the weave to create Dracoliches
- She convinced her sister Chauntea to hide Declan away in a safe place, ensuring he was exposed to the arcane arts, so that he might grow into a weapon she could use against the cult

combine material from pool of radiance: attack on myth drannor and anauroch: empire of shade (windsong tower episode) to create an adventure centered on returning to myth drannor; can have plot tie-ins for declan?

the Doom Raiders as a rival party to the QG who work for the Zhentarim, and may sometimes help and other times hinder - maybe a betrayal/working to restart the moonsea war?

thurndan tallwand secretly taking over the zhentarim, and working with the cult to mass-produce weapons that can cast *dweomerburst* to sell to the cities of the moonsea, restarting the moonsea war. he was the one who had the lord regent of phlan assassinated. he also *imprison*s people who threaten him, hence the bard in the book. he ensured that sahnd would find the cadorna evidence. jeralla was a liaison from the cult of the dragon to thurndan, and the bard in the book was his gift to her, but she went rogue when he didn't respect her wild magic

sahnd has finally found a partner willing to finance his efforts to retake phlan - the zhentarim. he travels east to Mulmaster to negotiate with them (really manipulated by thurndan) and learns that mulmaster will tacitly support this effort by paying for the zhent forces, in exchange for exclusive trading rights once the city is under zhent control. thurndan advises the high blades to do this and the city's nobility is well aware what they are getting into, seeing it as a foolproof option - if the zhents fail, they lose nothing except coin.

the mastermind behind the next moonsea war is TYRANTHRAXUS possessing someone

ttx spirit wandered the wastes of thar for years after the ren incident possessing garbage and seething; finally he possessed a magic user [bard in book] and got her to thurndan. jumped to thurndan and immediately imprisoned her because she knew what he had been doing. attracted jeralla as a underling, gave her book as a reward.
