# Heifer of a Situation

Date: August 30, 2020

- Looking for a way out of town, the gang quickly discovers that the Black Fist are mustering more forces to block the entrances and exits in the old city wall. Mantor's library has an extra garrison of knights posted in front of it.
- Sprinting to the Southeastern gate, the gang catch up to the Black Fist just as they are executing orders to block the gate. Declan convinces the sergeant to let them through, playing up the need to deliver food to Kabel's Hill.
- Outside the city walls, the gang pays visits to the armorer Bryce Vang and weaponsmith Alero and learns the local gossip about the Grey Patriots. Vang recalls that Sahnd Krulek was exiled from the Black Fists after his investigation fingered a noble that was too powerful to bring down. Afterward, the gang hear the same story about Krulek from the retired adventurer Marten Foss.
- Ready to celebrate their successes in the Quivering Forest, the gang heads back out to Kabel's Hill to meet Amer and Artin and spend the afternoon drinking in the Leaky Bucket. Despite the relatively small crowd and early hour, the people of Kabel's Hill make a spirited effort to celebrate their newfound safety.
- Declan passes out early, while the rest of the gang becomes drunker by the hour. When Calcey demands to know why more of the villagers haven't shown up, Peregrine stumbles outside to fire off a guiding bolt into the evening sky.
- Calcey entices the farmers into gambling, eventually taking some money off of nearly everyone present. She meets her match in the form of a grizzled old cowherd, who seems wise to her tricks. At the bar, he makes at pass at her but is politely rejected.
- The next morning, Hagar goes outside to relieve himself and discovers Calcey asleep behind the leaky bucket. The gang awake to thunderous hangovers and a foggy, overcast Marpenoth day.
