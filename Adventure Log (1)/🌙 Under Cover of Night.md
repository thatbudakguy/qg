# Under Cover of Night

Date: July 5, 2020

- Peregrine and Hagar visit Bryce Vang, learning that he has found a potential buyer for Peregrine's damaged armor who would prefer to meet in person. Peregrine sets a date to meet the buyer at the Laughing Goblin the next morning around 11.
- Calcey and Declan visit Fillistrom and learn that his only daughter Villona has been detained by the Black Fist for reasons unknown. They stock up on potions and herbal remedies.
- The gang visits the lord sage and returns Aya's book. Noticing Denlor's headband, the lord sage asks for it back. Hagar is able to convince him to let the gang keep it given that they're on the cusp of foiling the cult's plans.
- The gang visits scribe master Cassra and receives the results of their research inquiry, including information about the Cult of the Dragon, Tiamat, and the Dragonspine Mountains along with a *Scroll of Flame Blade*.
- Returning to the Cracked Crown, the gang collects mail from Jimmy Buckets, including an invitation from Millivent Moss to a Highharvesttide celebration the following evening.
- The gang heads back to Madame Freona's to rendezvous with Glevith and inform him of the cult's involvement in the most recent book thefts. Recognizing the dragon amulet as definitive proof of the cult's involvement, he pays the gang 100gp.
- Briefly stopping by Scholar's square to pick up Aya Glenmiir, the gang sneaks out to Kabel's Hill after dark to exhume the buried scale. Aya performs an identify spell on it, but no actual properties are revealed.
- Wrapping the scale in a sheet, the gang are preparing to leave Kabel's hill when they are approached by a figure with a torch.
