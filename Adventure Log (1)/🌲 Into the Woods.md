# Into the Woods

Date: August 5, 2020

- Debating whether or not to confront the Hag, the gang ultimately elects to first visit the Elven settlement of Greenhall and see if they can get some insight as to what happened with Halvin. Serelis clarifies that he will only accompany them to Greenhall.
- Heading into the forest, the gang is bewildered by an array of strange sounds and sights - babies laughing, women crying, and the movement of something large and unseen through the trees. Serelis advises them to stay close.
- On their first day of travel, the gang receives strange gifts, including a flower crown for Hagar and a handful of bunchberries for Declan, who was unable to forage any. In the evening, a strange flower blooms inside Declan's arcane focus.
- As the gang continues to travel through the forest, the gifts change into mostly harmless pranks - Peregrine's shoes are tied together and Hagar drifts off into the forest while asleep. The gang hears faint laughter each time a prank is discovered.
- Fed up with the messing around, Peregrine casts *detect evil and good* and determines that the party are accompanied by several very small good-aligned fey. When the party address them politely, a single pixie appears but doesn't quite seem to understand Calcey's attempts to communicate.
- At the conclusion of the second full day, the party again prepares to make camp in the forest. Serelis assures them that Greenhall is not too far ahead.
