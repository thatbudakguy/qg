# Bloody Nose

Date: June 10, 2020

- Leaving the Lamarck residence, the gang visits the Laughing Goblin to check in with Fat Mar, who says he hasn’t seen any of the three suspicious scholars in quite awhile.
- On the way back from the goblin, a mysterious elvish (?) figure gets the gang’s attention, claiming to deliver information from the welcomers.
- Upon following the figure into an alley, the gang are ambushed by a crew of halfling guards and Fulta the halfling spy.
- In a bloody battle to the finish, [Calcey Firecrotch](https://www.notion.so/Calcey-Firecrotch-8ca86cdef97e40aaa598ac030b627ee5)  is gored by Fulta’s sneak attack while [Hagar Bloodrop](https://www.notion.so/Hagar-Bloodrop-90ad0d4c4ab64b7597fe9268875efc55)  splits the disguised human thug in two with one axeblow.
- Licking their wounds and combing the alley, the gang discover a note penned by a mysterious “B” asking someone named Soares to “just get it done.”
- The Black Fist arrive to one hell of a crime scene with some questions to ask.
