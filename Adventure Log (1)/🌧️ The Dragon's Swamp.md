# The Dragon's Swamp

Date: June 21, 2020

- Traversing the sewers of Phlan, the gang comes upon a large pool fed by the Stojanow river via a spillway. On the other side of the pool are two carrion crawlers, feasting on the corpse of a third.
- Attempting to sneak up for a closer look, Calcey slips off into the sewer and is pulled downriver until Hagar offers a helping hand. The carrion crawlers make their attack.
- Maximilian's hand restrains and then pulverizes one carrion crawler while the other manages to paralyze Peregrine. With a fury belying her hundred-plus years, Calcey defends Peregrine's body while covered in sewer grime and skewers the other carrion crawler.
- Among the possessions strewn around, the gang discovers a note to Ellison asking him to meet Rythnax in the Twilight Marsh.
- Proceeding East as night falls, the gang confirms Peregrine's hypothesis by discovering the campfire where an injured Ellison waits with Rythnax.
- Coordinating their attack, the gang get the jump on Rythnax but are burned by his acid breath weapon, though his scornful Draconic insults are only intelligible to Peregrine.
- An injured Ellison turns on Rythnax, refusing to kill the gang. The dragon's lair magically assaults the gang with grasping water, stinging insects, and a sphere of darkness.
- As Rythnax finally attempts to flee, Calcey's desperate hand crossbow shot fells the young Wyrmling as he is on the brink of escape.
