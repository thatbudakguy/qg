# The New Scroll Thieves

Date: December 30, 2020

- Stealing out the back door of Gensor's former residence, the gang's escape is almost complete when Peregrine gets tripped up by the carpet. When Arthur comes to investigate, Declan conjures a series of illusions that scare him senseless, and the gang makes their escape.
- Peregrine picks up his armor from Bryce Vang's, encountering some suspicion but no real resistance from Alexi the guard. Meanwhile Calcey pays Chaab a visit to collect, and Declan cleans up the lecture hall in Denlor's tower.
- Putting their heads together, Declan and Peregrine are able to determine that the magical trap affecting the door to Denlor's scroll chamber is only a danger to creatures of chaotic alignment. Inside, they find a bounty of scrolls of evocation magic.
- When the gang finds the inner door locked, Calcey is unable to pick it so Hagar opts to get physical. On the other side is a small room lined with cabinets containing all manner of magical spell components, though evidently none of any great value.
- Resting up for their imminent journey, the gang prepare themselves to depart Phlan. Declan pays scribe master Cassra a visit and learns some more details about Claugilyamatar and the *imprisonment* spell possibly affecting the soul trapped in the book.
