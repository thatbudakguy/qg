# What Dreams May Come

Date: December 2, 2020

- The gang make their way through the cave system down to sea level, with Sirge and the caravan guards in tow. At the rocky beach, the guards debate what to do about the longship. Ilham is eager to turn the ship into cash, but young Calvin Bramblebottom strikes a deal with the gang to operate it at as a merchant vessel and give the gang 20% of their profits.
- The two dwarves are hesitant at first, but after the gang give their blessing (and over the objections of Ilham) Calvin becomes the new captain of the *Seagull's Caw*. The dwarves stay behind to make a fire while the rest of the guards row out to see what useful items they can scavenge from the ship.
- The gang and Sirge take the remaining dinghy out into the bay to meet the *Kite,* conscious of their exhausted state. The crew greet everyone with trepidation, having feared for their safety. Elma provides a hot cup of tea, and the gang stumble belowdecks to find a bunk in which to pass out.
- Before sleep, Declan is confronted by the book he took from Jeralla's wagon, which seems to be angrily indicating that it had a part to play in the owlbear's capture - it recounts the tale of how Jeralla stole the owlbear from a druid of the Quivering Forest, and how the creature could be placated with an Elvish phrase.
- Finding that the book radiates necromantic magic, Declan confirms that none of the rest of the gang's treasure has any magical properties before promptly passing out. Strange dreams come to all about the *Kite*.
- The gang wake late to a stormy morning on the Moonsea, as Sirge and the crew make the *Kite* ready to head back to Phlan.
