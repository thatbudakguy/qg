# Greenhall

Date: August 12, 2020

- The gang decide to gift the extra arrows recovered from the corpse to Serelis, who gratefully accepts them. He explains that the purple-hued wood of the shaft is Morcant Burl, from a species of tree exclusive to the Quivering Forest.
- The group finally reaches Greenhall, an elven settlement deep in the woods. Upon arrival, a small contingent of Elvish warriors mobilizes and demands to know the party's intention.
- Finding the elves extremely unwilling to negotiate, Declan attempts to explains the gang's presence. The hunters proudly report that they shot down the emissaries from Kabel's Hill, but appear to have no knowledge of Halvin whatsoever.
- Declan impresses upon the Elvish leader the importance of what the gang has learned from Halvin's diary, but his patience has run out and the Elves attack. Serelis flees, fearing the battle cannot be won. After Calcey knocks out one of the hunters, the rest of the gang follows suit under a hail of arrows.
- Struggling to find Serelis and gain their bearings, the gang meanders through the Quivering Forest, now without a guide. As everyone takes a moment to collect themselves, Declan revisits Halvin's diary and learns that the cult agent had a general idea of where he could have found Jeny.
- Seeking the guidance of the forest, Hagar performs a ritual that allows him to speak with animals. After providing a haughty crow with a liberal amount of rations, the gang learns that Jeny is not far off - they need only travel "to the sun".
- Gathering forest debris around them, Hagar constructs a few clever traps to alert the party if they are attacked in the night. The rest of the gang cover themselves with underbrush and prepare to get some sleep.
