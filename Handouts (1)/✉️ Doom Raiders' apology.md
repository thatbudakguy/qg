# Doom Raiders' apology

Type: ✉️ Letter

*Dearest Hagar,*

*We got off on the wrong foot, didn't we? I'm sorry about that. I can understand why it might have seemed to you that my friends and I appeared out of nowhere, after having hardly shown our faces during what was surely the most consequential battle on the Sword Coast in recent memory. Imagine our surprise when, after we infiltrated the hobgoblin fortress by posing as cultists, our cover was nearly blown because you had beaten us to the punch! The coordination could have been better, and I accept full responsibility.*

*But enough making excuses. The real tragedy of our little standoff at Westbridge was that we were never properly introduced! No doubt tongues have already whispered stories of the notorious Black Network into your ears. Well, I'd like to clear the air — the Network isn't some monster waiting to topple the governments of the sword coast. It's just a guild like any other — one that happens to be very profitable  for adventurers like us! So, you ask, who are we anyway?*

*First, I think you'd get along particularly well with Tashlyn — she's our Master of Arms and Mercenaries, and she holds great respect for those who prove their worth in combat. If for any reason you or your friends get into money trouble, you can count on Istrid to bail you out — she's our Master of Trade and Coin. If you need services of a more arcane nature, chances are Skeemo can take care of you; he's our Master of Magic and also runs a tidy little apothecary called Weirdbottle's Concoctions. If someone's been a thorn in your side a little too long, Ziraj can show you why they call him "the Hunter". The Network gave him the very subtle title of Master of Assassination, and being the strong, silent type, he didn't complain.*

*And that leaves me. All things considered, I have it pretty easy: Master of Opportunities and Negotiations is a job you can do without ever lifting a blade. The trick, of course, is separating the wheat from the chaff. If you ever come across a business opportunity that's simply too interesting to pass up, I keep a room at the Yawning Portal — just tell Durnan you're looking for me. I'd be delighted.*

*Next time you visit the City of Splendors, I do hope you'll call on us. We're all on the same side, after all.*

*P.S. I do hope this managed to reach you without an inordinate delay. You're a hard man to find!*
