# Letter to Thalder

Type: ✉️ Letter

*Thalder,*

*Into your hands passes the very fate of the faithful of Sammaster. The way has been prepared for the coming of the Maimed Virulence, and all that remains is to convey to the great Claugilyamatar the glory that awaits her son. Lt. Bolver has assured me that his Tears of Virulence stand ready to defend our claim. By the first snowfall of winter, a dragon will sit on the Cinnabar Throne.*

*I need hardly remind you that the Red Wyrmspeaker and his cronies are even now working at cross purposes to us. No doubt you will find them burrowed into the dwellings of the Zartruss, whispering the falsehoods of Tiamat. Remember: the way to the heart of a dragon is through its ears. You are a wearer of purple. Go and prove your worthiness.*

*J.P.*
