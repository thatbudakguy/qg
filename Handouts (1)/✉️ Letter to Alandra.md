# Letter to Alandra

Type: ✉️ Letter

*Dearest Alandra,*

*Severin's years of toil in search of the Dragon Masks have yielded a bounty we who venerate the Dragon Queen could have never imagined: all but one are now in our grasp. It is time to prepare a hoard worthy of the Bane of Bahamut, she who has smiled on us even as she lies imprisoned in the Nine Hells.*

*Though we of the scaly way have sought the attention of the great Claugilyamatar for centuries, our very own Greenspeaker now holds her ear like none before. The arrival of her queen now plays upon the theater of her mind, a possibility she had never entertained before Severin made it so.*

*Now, you must be the voice that whispers into this great ear. Go to the dwellings of the Zartruss in Kryptgarden and win for us the final piece in the puzzle the Redspeaker has been so long in assembling: the Green Dragon mask. I cannot do this, for preparations in the north consume me utterly, else I would go myself.*

*Your courage in the face of danger was long overdue for a reward. Consider this the greatest opportunity to fall into your lap since Tiamat brought you to us. The glory of all dragons, and all Faerun, depends on you.*

*Rezmir the Black*
