# Letter to Gensor in Basement

Type: ✉️ Letter

*Gensor,*

*I grow weary of pretending in front of the council. When will you be ready? I have arranged everything as you asked, and supplied innumerable subjects for your experimentation, to say nothing of the expenditure of coin and outfitting of the laboratory.*

*Sitting on my "throne" now fills me with anger. I shall not wait much longer to seize my place atop its true counterpart in Valjevo Keep. If you insist on carrying out this plan, your time grows short. You will find me considerably less willing a subject than the insignificant souls on whom you perform your rituals.*

*Raaxil*
