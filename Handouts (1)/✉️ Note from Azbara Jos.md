# Note from Azbara Jos

Type: ✉️ Letter

*Your arrival at Castle Naerytar has not escaped my notice. If you wish to avoid the same fate as your friends, I suggest you meet me in my quarters on the first floor of the keep. Take care that you are not seen by Dralmorrer Borngray or Wyrmspeaker Rezmir. My business is with you alone.*

*We may not be friends, but we don't need to be enemies.*

*Azbara Jos of Thay*
