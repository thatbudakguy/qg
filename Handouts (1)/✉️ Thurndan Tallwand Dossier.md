# Thurndan Tallwand Dossier

Type: ✉️ Letter

*Dear Calcey,*

*You've got some very powerful friends...or anyway I hope they're friends.*

*I was able to find some information about Mr. Tallwand, but it's all fairly recent. Normally people holding such a high office leave a little more of a paper trail, but it seems he either led a very boring early life or took pains to conceal his time before joining the Brotherhood of the Cloak. In the case of powerful wizards, a boring early life is generally not very likely...at least in my experience.*

*Court records from Mulmaster place Thurndan there starting about thirty years ago – I was able to source a ship's manifest that records his place of origin as Luskan. On paper, he looks unremarkable: an itinerant mage of moderate skill, making the move to the big city. Documentation from the next 20 years is few and far between, but we know that he enlisted with the Brotherhood of the Cloak, the local mage's guild, shortly after arrival and quickly rose in the ranks.*

*Records of the Cloaks are considerably harder to get access to, but according to the memoirs of one of his contemporaries, Thurndan seems to have had an intense energy that didn't sit well with some of his colleagues. Regardless, his rise to power was inexorable – by the turn of the century he reportedly had the ear of the High Blade Jaseen Drakehorn, and none dared challenge his council at court. Thurndan also seems to have been fond of business and diplomatic voyages, taking many trips throughout the moonsea at the behest of the nobility.*

*More recently, he seems to have been at the center of an investigation involving the theft of a highly valuable artifact. Evidently the wizard owned a magical blade that was stolen in a high-profile heist. Suspicion naturally turned to jealous colleagues, but when all were eventually exonerated, the Lord's Alliance stepped in to ensure judgment was meted out. It seems that in 1507 the thief was finally caught, but Thurndan elected to keep the affair under wraps to "protect the privacy" of those involved. I have to say, I've never heard of someone escaping public punishment for such a crime!*

*By all accounts, Mr. Tallwand seems to continue to wield enormous power in Mulmaster. I wouldn't be surprised to see him play an important part in Moonsea politics for years to come. Mages have a way of sticking around...*

*Yours,*

*C. Brandywine*
