## Synopsis

Perhaps the gang could return to the Moonsea here for an underwater expedition to Northkeep, the ancient city that was the first human settlement in the Moonsea near Calcey's home of Elmwood. All that remains of Northkeep now is the Bell in the Deep, a ghostly tower of the old city that sailors speak of in legends. Could Northkeep hold a secret key to defeating the cult?

Northkeep's founding and flourishing is roughly contemporaneous with Myth Ondath, the city in the North that was assaulted by the Ice Queen and from which Hagar's ancestors escaped.

Maybe the trail leads to Myth Ondath, and eventually to the *Gatekeeper's Crystal?* Maybe Declan's half-brother and Eldreth Valuuthra are planning to offer the crystal as their contribution to the cult's efforts, and the gang is in a race to stop them from acquiring the crystal.

In this act, we would learn that Eldreth Valuuthra are seeking the *Gatekeeper's Crystal*, and that Declan's half-brother intends to give it to the cult to use - maybe because Galvan or Severin have located the Warblade (at the Twisted Tower?), and that's what he desires most, so he's going to make a trade.

In this act, the forces jockeying for influence in the Moonsea (Zhentarim, Tyranthraxus's forces) could be gearing up for war.
