# Overview

This scale was shed by Tiamat tens of thousands of years ago during the Dragonfall Wars, a conflict between Tiamat and her brother Bahamut that divided all dragonkind. It lay undiscovered for millenia buried in the Dragonspine mountains until...

The scale is infused with divine magic created by rituals of the *Circle of the Scale*, who long ago became corrupted by the scale and sought to free Tiamat from her imprisonment. It is a true relic of Tiamat, but its power is much diminished, and is correlated to Tiamat's proximity to the material plane. While she remains imprisoned, it does not operate at its full potential.

When certain major events happen that correspond to Tiamat becoming closer to being freed from imprisonment, the Scale's properties change and it gains in power. It also exerts a more powerful influence over its wielder.

The New Cult sought this artifact because of its connection to Tiamat, but did not know its true powers. They had heard that it had the power to control dragons, but the truth is quite the reverse: its divine nature will result in its wielder being *controlled* by the Queen of dragons, unless they exert a tremendous force of will.

## Interactions

Aya Glenmiir sought to *identify* the artifact, but was stymied. This is because it was not a magical item crafted by a human, but instead a relic of a god later warped and infused with druidic magics. A *detect magic* reveals the spells the Druids imbued the scale with in their worship, but has no bearing on the Scale's true nature.
