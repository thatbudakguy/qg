# History

Raised in an orphanage operated by the noble Cassalanter family in Waterdeep's raucous Dock Ward. Reclaimed as a ward of his uncle Jaeger at age 12, and subsequently exposed to the seedy criminal underbelly of the City of Splendors. Became the de facto leader of the Foxteeth, a motley band of streetwise teenage thieves who lived one step ahead of the City Watch. Fell in with agents of the Cult of the Dragon, who whispered tales of dragon-hoards into his ear exchanged for fealty to Tiamat. Amassed a small fortune given over almost entirely to the cult, before crossing the line in a final job that shook him to the core. Pulled strings to get himself "transferred" to the Moonsea, away from the long arm of the law, and promptly cut ties with the cult to reinvent himself as a man of the faith.

# Appearance

Illuskan youth barely out of his teenage years, with light skin, short dark hair, and brown eyes. Tall, with the sinewy build and tightly wound energy of a street tough. Face often set in a bored or quizzical expression while sizing up you or the room. Wears a smirk for friends, and a frown for foes. Perpetually serious to the point of being comic. Reminds you of Hayden Christiansen in *Attack of the Clones.*

# Talents

Was raised in a strict boarding school-like environment until age 12, and absorbed a good deal of the history of Waterdeep and its noble families. Born tactician who easily recognizes and exploits flaws in the defenses of both buildings and people. Has a sixth sense for grifters and liars, having grown up around his fair share of them. Can read and understand basic Draconic, having pursued initiation with the Cult of the Dragon.

# Mannerisms

Rushes through his sentences when speaking to the opposite sex, sometimes tripping over words or cutting himself off. Prone to making dark pronouncements ("I have a bad feeling about this...") for no particular reason. Sighs dramatically. Has random crises of confidence and constantly questions his own decisions. Refuses to sit in chairs properly. Insomniac.

# Interactions

Fits in easily with other city folk like Calcey. Sometimes scorns peasants, but has to admit to himself that they have none of the problems he does, and even wistfully admires the simple lives of people like Hagar. Feels like a fraud in front of other clerics. Polite to a fault in front of nobility, but privately believes they're a corrupt pack of dogs. Sees nepotism and conspiracy everywhere.

# Ideals

Believes that some people, particularly children, are saints untouched by the corruption of the world and will go far in order to protect them from harm. Adheres unflinchingly to his own moral code, which forbids harming those who cannot help themselves. Is often acutely embarrassed on behalf of his companions and makes pains to apologize for or smooth over their social missteps. Desires fervently to  atone for his past sins.

# Bonds

Feels enormous guilt at abandoning the Foxteeth, to whom he was effectively a father figure, for the cult. Is unsure what to make of the fact that the Quarantine Gang seem to appreciate him for who he is without needing him to be someone else, which he's never experienced before from anyone. Has never  felt the need for a parent in his life, but would kill for a sibling with whom he can be honest.

# Flaws

Poor upbringing has led him to alternately idolize and revile the highborn. Abandons people, places, and faiths willingly when he feels there is a benefit to doing so. Wears whatever face he feels is most likely to get him what he needs from someone.
