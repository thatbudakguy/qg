Working at the Leaky Bucket isn't the most exciting job you've had, but it certainly isn't the worst.  

Grinna is slow to dispense the secrets of her cooking, and having dined on it more than a few times, you can understand why. The fact that she regularly assembles everything from quiche to shepherd's pie using only the ingredients native to the northern Moonsea is astounding. At times, you question how on earth the hapless Hupe managed to get so lucky. You don't remember anybody back in Elventree that could cook like this â€“Â definitely not mom, anyway.

With the removal of the Hag from the Quivering Forest, the tiny hamlet seems to have reverted to its formerly sleepy self. Some days you see only one or two other people, usually in the mornings, visiting the little outfitter and farm store run by Colvin Brenick. Sooner or later, though, everyone comes by to have one of Grinna's famous breakfasts: Amer and Artin, the young men you rescued from the Hag's cage, Hurg Pilauwer, the hulking town blacksmith, the Moss family of peat farmers, even young captain Calvin Bramblebottom, whose longship is awaiting warmer weather in the bay of Phlan.

As the snows grow more frequent and the traffic between Kabel's Hill and the city slows to a trickle, the little village prepares for the Feast of the Moon, marking the beginning of winter in earnest. Being handy with a vehicle, the Brightbells often send you to Phlan to procure ingredients. Their rickety wooden cart is pulled by Francis, an old mule so expressionless it's often difficult to tell if he's awake. Francis is content to navigate to and from the city without any intervention on your part, except when the weather makes things difficult.

Oddly, business at the Leaky Bucket seems to be picking up â€“ certainly more than you experienced during the fall, when it was a rarity to see any more than one or two patrons at a time in the place during the day outside of the Brightbells themselves. Moreover, horse-drawn carts and sweaty young men and women seem to be delivering crates of provisions to the establishment fairly frequently. When you pull Hupe aside to ask about this one cold evening in Nightal, he keeps his eyes downcast but gives you an uncharacteristically straightforward reply: "Not all the foolks in Kabel's Hill can provide fer theysselves all year 'roond."

Stunned, you realize just how consequential your choice to help out through the winter may prove to be. If not all the farmers of Kabel's Hill can support themselves, who puts food on the table? As a slightly drunk Haldred Moss explains to you during the Feast of the Moon festivities, the wealthier farms have always tried to provide for those who suffer a meagre harvest. Or as he tactfully puts it, "ye can't eat peat...but peats buys meat!" In this communal system, the Leaky Bucket functions as both the literal and metaphorical center of Kabel's Hill, being both an Inn and a sort of food bank. Looking out on the all the merry drinking and dancing, you can't help but wonder if every city nobleman secretly dreams about the life these peasants lead.

On any given night like this, the old Calcey would probably end up passed out in some stable or pasture. How much harder to bear it, then, wondering how many years you have left to spend in this body, with your withered mind? Yet the hearthfire of the Leaky Bucket warms you in a way you haven't felt since childhood â€“Â the feeling of being part of a family. The Brightbells are the first people you can remember who immediately accepted you for who you are, and the first since your mother with whom you can speak the halfling language you learned as a child. Though you might not admit it to your friends, you seem to be growing to need the couple just as much as they need you.

As the snows deepen into the month of Hammer, you find yourself dreading each successive trip to the city. Francis loses his footing more frequently, scaring you half to death and occasionally spilling some of the valuable cargo from the market. Despite bundling yourself up until you look like some kind of dwarven blanket cleric, the cold slices through you like a chef's knife, stripping away your perception of time and enveloping you in a mental fog.

A few days before the Midwinter festival, a raging snowstorm kicks up as you are exiting the Northern gates of the city, the Black Fist sentries wrapping their helmets in rags and fleeing from atop the battlements to the safety of gate's interior. You've scarcely traveled a few hundred feet from the walls when the city is all but invisible, the world a swirling globe of frost. Francis shivers, shaking the reins in your hands which have long gone numb.

The hours begin to run together, until finally you're forced to admit that the palisade walls of Kabel's Hill should have emerged from the blizzard a long time ago. Eventually, Francis simply stops walking, his ancient body refusing to put out any more energy. Exhausted, you find yourself unable to get out of the driver's seat to drive the mule, weakly moving the reins as your vision begins to leave you. As you slump over to lay along the riding board of the cart, a strange kind of warmth fills your body â€“Â the comfort of hypothermia. For some reason, your last thoughts are of Cere, that wild girl who first taught you how to pick locks. Where is she now?

You're conscious of the total lack of feeling in your arms before you open your eyes. Immediately the fear wells up within you: why can't I move my hands? You sit bolt upright and are met with a gentle but firm hand that pushes your chest back to the simple bed. "Rest. You are not ready yet." Cursing at the pain, you turn to your right to find the solemn visage of the ranger Serelis Greenleaf, his hands submerged in a pail of steaming water and herbs. You take in the interior of the simple wooden cabin, eventually pausing to stare at your arms, purple and blackened from the wrists downward. Serelis follows your eyes. "You will get them back. Patience." And somehow, in a matter of days, you do.

On the day of the Midwinter festival, you return to Kabel's Hill to be welcomed by an overjoyed Hupe and Grinna brightbell. The cargo you've brought has arrived not a moment too soon, and you set about the preparations for the evening's feast, which will take the remainder of the day. The roast chickens are the centerpiece, enough to feed the entire village twice over, slow-cooked over a peat fire and dressed with herbs and spices from all over the Moonsea. When you finish the last one and the Leaky Bucket opens its doors, all Grinna can do is smile proudly.

As you bask in the firelight, grateful to be alive and in good company, an unexpectedly cold chill runs down your spine. You turn, wondering if the door has been left ajar, and suddenly a familiar voice is in your ear: "My little thief. Are we playing at chef, now? Oh, how your memory has faded." Suddenly the Leaky Bucket disappears, and you see yourself in a much younger body, wrapping a garotte around the neck of a old nobleman kicking and gasping as his life slips away. "Remember this: you are the violent kind. When the time comes, you will be my sword."

When the snows finally begin to melt and you return to Phlan, these words are heavy on your mind.
