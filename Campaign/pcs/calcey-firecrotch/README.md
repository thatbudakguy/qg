# History

Raised by a single mother in Elmwood, a sleepy community on the southeastern shore of the Moonsea. Displayed promise as a hired farmhand, earning just enough to offset her mother's penchant for drink. Moved quickly to thieving when she learned the tricks of the trade from a childhood friend, and before long drew the ire of the town's constable. Exiled "for the good of the community" to work at a temple in nearby Mulmaster, the City of Danger. Rapidly established herself via a string of heists as one of the city's most daring and beloved thieves, in the guise of "Danger's Blade". Doesn't speak about her long twilight of the soul spent wandering the eastern Moonsea.

# Appearance

Elderly halfling woman with a lithe posture and relentless, youthful energy. Shock of pixie-cut white hair hides brown eyes surrounded by laughter lines. Leathery face betrays years of hard labor and hard drinking. Smile somewhere between a hungry fox and a child on Christmas morning. Reminds you of Susan Sarandon (with white hair).

# Talents

Blends in effortlessly with common folk, which she uses to maximum advantage when pursued by agents of the law. Retains many knife tricks from her time as a thief, which can dazzle tavern patrons. Shrewd gambler who can empty a merchant's purse over the course of a night. Knows thieves' cant.

# Mannerisms

Speech peppered with curses and colorful expressions, which can turn heads in a crowd. No patience for those like Declan who use flowery language to sweeten their appearance. Flagrantly misuses big words to display her scorn for the overeducated. Eats and drinks a surprising volume for her small frame, yet brazenly takes extra helpings of food and drink "for later". Snores incredibly loudly.

# Interactions

Unflappable sense of humor; responds to criticism and catcalls alike with a wink and a crude joke. Violence immediately provokes a response in kind from her fiery temper. Needles people incessantly once she figures out what makes them tick. Has no problem making the first move, in love or in violence. Quickly bores of people who can't make up their mind. Loves to drink bigger folk under the table.

# Ideals

Fierce defender of the right of the common people to live the lives they deserve. Believes that tyrannical rulers are a more real, everyday threat than any magic or beast. Delights in taking revenge on those who have wronged her, and fully supports the rights of others to do the same. Chalks her skills as a thief up to hard work and determination, and believes she deserves everything she comes by, honestly or otherwise.

# Bonds

Loves (and can't stand) her mother with the stubbornness of an only child. Retains a strong bond with peasants and those who work the land, having spent her early years as a farmhand. Has an easy friendliness with others who have spent their life in large cities and urban areas, like Peregrine. Reserves a special warmth for other halflings, particularly those who treat her like a member of their extended family. Prefers friendships in which she can "work hard, play hard" and no joking or roughhousing is off-limits.

# Flaws

Long history with alcohol; walks a knife edge between merry carousing and violent depression when truly drunk. Childhood spent trying to support her family in a poor backwater followed by years as a thief means money is a huge motivation. Deeply ingrained mistrust for any military or lawkeeping organizations, magical or otherwise, even those that claim to be forces for good.
