# History

Raised by the Varm tribe of the Eraka people, who are indigenous to the steppeland known as The Ride in northern Faerun. Discovered by a warband in the aftermath of a battle sitting – apparently unbothered – alone on the plains covered in blood at the age of three. Trained in the tradition of totem magic by his adoptive parents, who sent him into the military at the age of 12. Completed a spirit quest prior to leaving home that left him with more questions than answers. Brought honor to his family by serving with the Company of the Raven in multiple campaigns in Thar, a former Ogre kingdom and lawless region east of The Ride. Left the Company to do some soul-searching at the end of a particularly brutal campaign.

# Appearance

Tall and heavily muscled, with proudly worn scars from years of combat. Jade skin, with visible but relatively understated tusks for a half-orc and large ears. Chiseled face of quarterback or movie star. Deep-set red eyes and large brows, with a serious and piercing gaze that strangers often can't meet eye-to-eye. Close-cropped, jet-black hair kept pulled tightly back using refined animal fat, a technique he learned in the military. Reminds you of a young Tommy Lee Jones.

# Talents

Speaks the Erakic language in addition to the Common and Orc he picked up during his military service. Traveling and fighting on horseback are second-nature, having been raised by a culture founded on both horse husbandry and combat. Strong survival instincts from years spent traveling the plains, far from civilization. Deep connection to animals, with access to some rituals that can enhance this bond.

# Mannerisms

Startles even his friends with unpredictable bursts of laughter or anger. Awkward and clumsy around small-folk like gnomes and halflings, with whom he has little experience and no idea how to act. Poor volume control. Talks with his mouth full of food. Often gruff, in the manner of a cowboy. Can't back down from a direct challenge, no matter who issues it.

# Interactions

Bonds quickly with those he battles alongside, and puts himself in danger for them without hesitation. Respects anyone who demonstrates their skills with steel, but refuses to bow to those who use their powers to dominate or control others. Vaguely distrusts those of zealous divine faith, as his connection is more to natural forces and primal spirits. Can be provoked into a violent rage when protecting himself or his companions, during which he feels almost no pain.

# Ideals

Reveres nature and natural forces as the source of balance and life that sustains the world. Believes that no man-made forces or objects, including those of magic, can stand against the powers of time and tide. Defends the right of others to express themselves freely, and identifies with the struggles of native peoples and the oppressed at the hands of larger social organizations or civilization. Was raised believing that his rage is a pure and noble state that exists outside human affectations; a more primal way of being.

# Bonds

Strong loyalty to the tribe who raised him, matched by a dutiful (if not particularly warm) devotion to the Company of the Raven. Some attachment to those, like Declan, who have spent little time in modern civilization and share some of his awkwardness at being in highly populated areas. Longs to discover the meaning behind the legends of the great Primal Spirits worshipped by his kinsmen. Fond of ancient tales about the first days of human settlement in the Moonsea.

# Flaws

Impulsive and rash; dislikes making detailed plans. No talent for subterfuge - was considered for a position as an informant within the Orc tribes of Thar, but passed over because of his lack of finesse. No mercy for the wicked, and considers torture justified against those who have demonstrated their disregard for human or animal life.
