# Laraelra Harsard

Laraelra is very thin and pale, with long black hair that highlights her severe features. She is a passionate idealist who sometimes breaks her reserved shyness with outbursts of sympathy for others.

Laraelra is the daughter of the guildmaster of Waterdeep's Cellarers and Plumber's Guild, Malaerigo Harsard. Her father has always disapproved of her decision to pursue magical studies, but in his advanced age there's little he can do about it now.

Malaerigo hired [Meloon Wardragon](Meloon%20Wardragon.md) to protect his daughter, but the two grew much closer than he anticipated, eventually becoming good friends and joining [Renaer Neverember](Renaer%20Neverember.md)'s Moonstars together.
