# Marten Foss

Faction: ../Factions%20edaaed8213e2408cb90615e4d1814587/Order%20of%20the%20Gauntlet%203b5006c9f1db47b58ecf0698a5da6ff4.md

This gruff but friendly adventurer made the unorthodox choice to retire to the Moonsea, settling in Phlan with his daughter Vera. Never one to back down from a good fight, Marten operates a combat training school from the courtyard of his simple home in New Phlan. Fighters and adventurers of all stripes are welcome to spar using a rack of prepared practice weapons, though they'd be lucky to land a hit on Vera, who is a fierce warrior as well as her father's pride and joy.

Though his adventuring days are behind him, Marten serves as a local liaison to the [Order of the Gauntlet](../../Factions/Order%20of%20the%20Gauntlet.md), helping to expose and punish evil wherever it appears. He is also an amateur historian, having a personal interest in the early Heroes of Phlan â€“ Ren o' the Blade in particular. One volume of the dwarf's personal copy of Ren's memoirs was stolen by [Cult of the Dragon](../../Factions/Cult%20of%20the%20Dragon.md) agents seeking more information about the Pool of Radiance underneath Phlan.

The Gang ultimately returned Marten's property after tracking down the Scroll Thief, Ellison Berenger, and consulted the memoirs in order to learn more about the Pool.
