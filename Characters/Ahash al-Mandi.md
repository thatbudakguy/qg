al-Mandi (who is referred to by his family name, in the Calishite fashion) is tall for a Calishite, with a prominent mustache and a blustery arrogance. He refers to himself in the third person.

A famed warlock of Calimport, al-Mandi was contracted by the House of al-Qutaa to represent the [Lord's Alliance](../Factions/Lord%27s%20Alliance.md)  at the battle of Kryptgarden. Though he survived the assault on the Zartruss fortress in [What's Up With That Catapult?](../Adventure%20Log/%E2%98%84%EF%B8%8F%20What%27s%20Up%20With%20That%20Catapult.md), the hired retinue who accompanied him north from Calimport were completely wiped out.
