Faction: ../Factions%20edaaed8213e2408cb90615e4d1814587/Harpers%20f87016ea46da4fec858732a38796985b.md

A tall, thin, half-elven monk who is soft-spoken but alert. Leosin hails from Berdusk, in the Western Heartlands, where he has served as a contact for the [Harpers](../Factions/Harpers.md) . The monk researches the [Cult of the Dragon](../Factions/Cult%20of%20the%20Dragon.md) , including its history and present objectives, and frequently travels between his home and Candlekeep.

He often communicates with fellow harpers[Aya Glenmiir](Aya%20Glenmiir.md) of Phlan and Remallia "Remi" Haventree of Waterdeep, and serves as a liaison between the Harpers and the [Order of the Gauntlet](../Factions/Order%20of%20the%20Gauntlet.md) through his friendship with [Ontharr Frume](Ontharr%20Frume.md).

Leosin trained [Sirge Wintermelt](Sirge%20Wintermelt/%21index.md), who he sent on a mission northward to the Moonsea and who was eventually rescued by the Quarantine Gang at King's Pyre. During the battle of Kryptgarden forest, Leosin landed a stunning strike directly on the great dragon Claugilyamatar, buying the Gang just enough time to flee to safety.
