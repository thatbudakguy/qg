Winona wears studded leather and wields a rapier. She can be absent-minded, and is always searching for something she's misplaced. Of her friends, she can be the most taciturn, but has a quick wit and even quicker hands. When a troll emerged suddenly from the Yawning Portal in [The Troll Hole](../Adventure%20Log/%F0%9F%95%B3%EF%B8%8F%20The%20Troll%20Hole.md), Winona faced it down without a second thought.

Winona is one of the HAWKs, a group of rogues from the [Harpers](../Factions/Harpers.md) who grew up together on the streets of Waterdeep's dock ward.
