## Background

Born in the Elven Court area of Cormanthor during the Elven kingdom's brief return to glory in 1377 DR, Eryn Ainath was a joy to everyone – most of all her parents, Chaedi and Erdan. During a time when the Elves of Faerun had more hope than in any of the centuries past, Eryn's birth and life represented the pinnacle of that hope: a child who delighted in songs and stories, knowing nothing of the cruel history of her people.

Yet the girl's strong will could not be controlled, and to the devastation of her parents she left the forest in search of adventure while still a child, in 1420. Joining up with the Harpers for the promise of adventure, Eryn trained in the Silver Marches, pledging to keep the North safe from threats both arcane and divine.

## Interactions

# Timeline

- In the early 1450s DR, the [Harpers](../../Factions/Harpers.md) were keeping a close eye on the [Arcane Brotherhood](../../Factions/Arcane%20Brotherhood.md)'s attempts to control the North, particularly the Silver Marches. Harper agents had long suspected that correspondence continued between the brotherhood and the [Red Wizards of Thay](../../Factions/Red%20Wizards%20of%20Thay.md) and other agents to the East.
- When [Thurndan Tallwand](../Thurndan%20Tallwand/%21index.md) (then known by his birth name Rastol Shan) was publicly exiled from Mulmaster in 1390 for affiliation with the Brotherhood, the Harpers watched him closely. Reports came in from agents in the north that Rastol was bound for Hellgate Keep, a city of demons which had been razed by Khelben hardly 30 years before.
- Rastol spent years scouring the ruins of the Keep, establishing himself as an itinerant mage in the area so as to build a cover story. The Harpers were happy to let him continue to occupy himself with whatever he was doing, confident he would not succeed in his task, since the site had been utterly destroyed by the use of the *Gatekeeper's Crystal*. They did not suspect that the *Crystal* was precisely what he was looking for.
- When Rastol suddenly abandoned Hellgate Keep and appeared in Luskan at the Host Tower of the Arcane in 1456 DR, Eryn was immediately assigned to keep close tabs on him. By this point Rastol was completely paranoid and using a high degree of anti-scrying magic, and the Harpers were determined to keep him under wraps for fear of what he had somehow discovered in the ruins.
- Posing as an impressionable young wizard, Eryn apprenticed herself to Shan. She soon found the mage completely transfixed by the power of the crystal's shard, and utterly devoted to research that he believed would allow him to use it to conquer the North. In the first year of their research together, the pair discovered something neither expected: the *Crystal* was both a weapon and a key, one designed to prevent *gate*s from ever being closed.
- Convinced that the *Crystal* would allow him to summon an extraplanar army capable of conquering the entire North, Rastol applied himself to a ritual he believed would complete the summoning. Eryn did everything in her power to secretly confuse and confound the mage, ensuring that his tools were lost or broken, and his valuable research met with unfortunate ends.
- Yet eventually Rastol's behavior began to change. The mage grew more and more distrustful of his apprentice, and Eryn sounded the alarm with the Harpers in 1479 DR, believing that he had become truly dangerous. In fact, the game was already up: Tyranthraxus had possessed Rastol, and was simply biding his time to let Eryn think she was the one in control.
- When the call went out to the Harper agents, the Great Possessor's hand was forced: he *imprison*ed Eryn and disappeared in 1480 DR, before the agents could zero in on his position. Finding the residents of Luskan downright unwilling to cooperate with their investigation, the Harpers were forced to concede defeat and wait for Rastol to resurface somewhere in the North, their efforts soon becoming focused on the War of the Silver Marches.
