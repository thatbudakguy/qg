# Outline

## Hook

The action begins on the morning of Alturiak 1 with the characters arriving in Parnast, having been outfitted that morning with three key things from Talis: a banner, a password, and a note. They are escorted through the mountain pass to the town by Kusphia, the Dragonclaw, and the two Veterans who serve Talis (Maelgot and Sorvic).

</aside>

> As the early morning light filters through the deep forests of the Graypeak mountains, you inhale the scent of pine boughs, taking in your surroundings: ahead, the dragon cultist called Kusphia leads the way to the mountain village of Parnast. She is dressed in the black cape and mask of a Dragonwing, as are your comrades, moving stealthily through the trees in a small group around you. Bringing up the rear are the two mercenaries Talis the White assigned to your guard detail, their heavy armor occasionally breaking the silence of the forest with muffled clanking. It is just after dawn on the morning of the first day of the month of Alturiak, and the signs of spring have finally come to the North.

> As you make you way through the forest, you recall Talis's commands to you last night. Across Hagar's back is strapped a ten-foot-long polearm, a faded length of colored fabric wrapped around its upper half. When unfurled and clearly visible, this standard will identify you as Cult forces, should you need to approach the closed gates of Skyreach. In Declan's pack is proof of your supposed mission: a letter sealed with Talis's personal emblem in white wax, to be delivered exclusively to a Wearer of Purple named Naergoth Bladelord. Naergoth is the commanding cultist at the Well of Dragons, the eventual destination of the castle, but your real mission will be completed long before it arrives: eliminate Rezmir the Black, take command of Skyreach Castle, and return it to Talis the White's hunting lodge. Using the lock of Hagar's hair that she received from you yesterday as a scrying focus, Talis has promised to check in on you...frequently.

üéµ Taiga ambience (last one on list)

</aside>

> After another hour stalking through the cold underbrush, the forest has begun to thin. Suddenly, you emerge at the top of a rocky ridge, looking down into an isolated mountain valley stretching away below you. Smoke curls from the chimneys of a few tiny buildings, clustered around a town square comprising a tavern, a stable, and a small shrine. Just beyond the edge of town, something massive lies shrouded in mist. Half-hidden in a ravine is a mighty ice castle with walls standing forty feet high, and huge thin towers stretching upwards to pierce the low clouds. Wisps of fog hide much of the castle's detail, but you can see two gigantic stone statues just in front of its gate. Kusphia turns to you. *This is where we leave you. She will be watching. Do not fail.* Without another word, Talis's servants vanish into the forest.

‚ùì What do you do?

## Parnast

Townsfolk the characters speak to may exchange grudging pleasantries, but mostly they're not interested in talking. If pressed, they may get suspicious as to the PC's intentions and why they haven't boarded the castle yet, letting slip that its departure is imminent within the hour.

Skyreach itself has been fully loaded with treasure, and is just taking on provisions at this point before it departs. These too have been nearly fully loaded; some of the villagers are delivering food and supplies in the last wagons just as the PCs arrive in the village.

### Flying to the Castle

If the characters tarry too long in Parnast, they'll have to catch the castle in flight, because it departs Skyreach momentarily.

### Boarding the Castle

If the characters enter accompanying other cultists or villagers who are loading provisions, no one will spend much time asking them questions. They won't need the banner to enter, but they may need to convince whoever is with them that they should be welcomed on board.

If the characters come to the castle without an escort, they'll need to fly the banner. If this happens, someone will come down to greet them. This will be Rezmir, and she'll naturally be suspicious as to why they were tarrying so long in Parnast. They may need to make opposed deception checks and/or show the letter in order to convince her to let them in.

If the characters stay in Parnast for any longer than a half hour or so, the castle leaves. They'll need to use the Wyverns to reach the castle. The villagers will direct them to Othelstan, who will let them use the Wyverns if they can prove themselves (succeeding on deception, showing the letter, etc). Then, they'll be greeted by Rezmir as soon as they land on the upper deck, and will need to repeat the same process as above.
