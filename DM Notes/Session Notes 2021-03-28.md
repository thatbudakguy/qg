# Outline

## Preparations

the Lord Sage and Aya Glenmiir meet the Gang at Denlor's Tower. However, the Lord Sage doesn't have information about when the Lord Regent will join, and he isn't present. He does have the [Thurndan Tallwand Dossier](../Handouts/%E2%9C%89%EF%B8%8F%20Thurndan%20Tallwand%20Dossier.md) to give to Calcey from Cassra.

After they cross the bridge, Aya finds the original Peregrine Buntly gravestone - "Just how many masks are you wearing?"

### Initiative

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Have everyone roll initiative before the code words are said so that you know what order to resolve things in. Fudge Cassyt's role to be highest so that she can hit Sirge first.

</aside>

Groups:

- The Kelemvorites (Yovir first)
- Aya/Lord Sage (Aya first)
- Fists (leaders first)
- Gang (separately)

> After an eternity of waiting, the winter dark is punctuated by low voices and the crunch of mailed boots on gravel. From the direction of the city, the group approaches. Leading them is a young half-elf wearing an ill-fitting suit of black plate mail, the front of which bears a splash of lurid green paint. Behind him are a contingent of armored knights whose chestpieces bear the same paint: a towering half-orc, a surly dwarf, and humans of all shapes and sizes. In total, they number more than 20, bristling with swords and clad in black plate mail smeared with green paint that glistens in the light of the torches they carry.
> 

## Ambush

When the Tears reach the back of the graveyard, the disguised kelemvorites are waiting for them. Leading the pack and intended to be Vorgansharax in disguise is Cassyt, who approaches Sirge without speaking.

> As the torchlight flickers in the winter night, the silence of the graveyard is overpowering. A young half-elf steps forward hesitantly, the green-splashed armor not quite fitting him right. As he approaches the robed cultists, the slight hooded form at the front of the group steps forward to meet him, speaking in a surprisingly familiar voice: "So! You're here to be our escort?" The half-elf falters for moment. "Uh, yeah. *And*...Dead dragons will rule the entire-" "Okay!" without waiting for him to finish, Cassyt cheerfully extends her hand [fudge roll] and Sirge freezes completely.
> 

### Tactics

- Cassyt pins Sirge to the spot, and then everyone else takes their turns in initiative order (the Tears are surprised).
- Sirge (Spy) is likely frozen for a lot of this battle. If unfrozen, he runs to cover, where he can snipe the Tears.
- Yovir opens with *spririt guardians*, targeting the area where the fists are most concentrated. Thereafter he uses his *divine eminence* ability every turn, heroically drawing the attention of the Fists in melee away from his acolytes. He has 50 HP.
- Acolytes of Kelemvor mostly stay out of melee, using *sacred flame* to attack and otherwise keeping the party topped up with *bless, sanctuary,* and *cure wounds*.
- Tears all have AC 18 (plate) but otherwise use Thug stats. They fan out and try to gang up on party members.
- Cron, Lt. Urakh, and Sgt. Ambershard are Knights, and Yerk is a Berserker (but with 18 AC).
- Aya (illusionist) has *mage armor* up, and opens with *phantasmal killer* on one of the leaders (activates displacement). Thereafter she uses *color spray* and *magic missile,* reserving *major image* for if someone gets into trouble.
- The Lord Sage does nothing except activate a *ring of invisibility* if he is cornered.
- If someone need to be stabilized, Elisande may appear randomly to do it.

## The Cavalry

After 10ish rounds, The Lord Regent and Aleyd Burral arrive with the remainder of the Black Fist.

> Suddenly, the sounds of battle are drowned out by the hammering of more mailed boots on gravel. A shout rings out above the melee: "Cron! Call off your men! This is the end of the line!" Emerging into the torchlight are the armored forms of a far greater force: the members of the Black Fist still loyal to the Lord Regent Ector Brahms, the noble figure who strides into the light side-by-side with Lt. Aleyd Burral. Cron turns his helmet to face the newcomers. "Tears! We came ready to die tonight. Now is the time to prove your devotion!" But in the next moment, the tension is broken by the sound of a blade clattering to the ground [foley]. It is followed by another, then another [foley], until the remaining Tears of Virulence stand unarmed in surrender to their former comrades. Cron shrieks "Noooooo!" and makes a mad charge for the Lord Regent.
> 

If no one intervenes, the Fists simply close ranks around their leader and cut down Cron where he stands.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Start the "The Name's Bond..." track in watch2gether before reading the next bit, and make sure you deliver the final line at around 35sec in.

> Calmly sheathing his blade, the Lord Regent speaks in a tone that makes it clear why he is considered fit to command the armies of Phlan. "Captain Barrelhelm. I see too many knights here under your command. Being so negligent is nearly as bad as being complicit. You are hereby relieved of your command. Lieutenant Burral. Your integrity is commendable. You will assume the Captaincy of Chains, effective immediately. Prepare the Stojanow Gate dungeons for their new inhabitants. This Cult of the Dragon virulence has spread far enough. It's long past time for it to be... [look at camera] *quarantined*."
