# Outline

## Skyreach Castle

TALIS SPYING!!!!

THE BOOK?

Once aboard, the characters will quickly be given orders. Their first task will be to assist with unloading the provisions that have just been loaded aboard, which will be scattered around the lower courtyard. The provisions are stored in the Storeroom (room 13) on the lower floor of the castle. 

> Description of the castle here.
> 

After the provisions are unloaded, the PCs will be left to their own devices. The other cultists will retire to the barracks to gamble, drink, and pass the time. If the PCs decide to explore instead, they will be discouraged but not actively prevented from this activity.

### Exploring

### Meeting Cultists

- Who do the PCs meet at the barracks?
