> What looks to be a well-appointed chamber is filled with furniture and can serve as a place to eat food or discuss important matters. Two grizzled men in the room wear scale mail and carry swords, another woman stands silently in the dark robes of a Dragonclaw, her faced shrouded by a mask. Behind them, a half-elven woman with short brown hair and a vicious smile wears lavish purple robes over white scale mail, and she holds a wand set with a blue gemstone. ‚ÄúWelcome. I am expecting guests. Please sit.‚Äù

Talis asks the PCs several questions:

- Which standing stone did they use? If the one from Naerytar, this is a good sign. She asks more deeply about their knowledge of the castle and how it is used, wanting to gain as much information as possible to use against Rezmir.
- What do they know of giants and their magic? This question is intended to see whether they are likely to survive aboard Skyreach Castle.
- How many people have they killed? This is asked bluntly to Hagar, followed by each of the party members in turn.

At some point Talis will lose patience, unless the PCs get to the point.

> So. Go ahead and ask, since you're obviously wondering. [if no one volunteers] Ask me what I want! [pause] ...only what I am due. Severin's eyes stray too frequently for my taste. I have been left by the wayside in favor of a blithering fool...Varram the Dwarf claims the title of White Wyrmspeaker. In spite of all I have done, the blood and sweat I have expended *daily* in the queen's name, Severin entrusts this pigheaded shit-for-brains with a Dragon Mask. And now I learn that Varram is beyond my grasp! Sent on another errand. So. What do I want? I want those in Severin's eyes to fail, that he might be persuaded to turn his gaze my way once again. I want them to slip. I want them to fall. Spectacularly. And if I can't have Varram...I'll take what I can get. Rezmir is no friend of mine. Thinking her ancestry makes her the perfect lieutenant. [pause]. So. You were already on your way to thwart her, were you not? You would have made it no further than Parnast. At best, your story would have ended as frozen corpses at the gates of Skyreach. I will get you aboard. And you will make Talis the white a Wyrmspeaker. Well?

### Agreement

If the PCs agree, Talis takes a lock of Declan's hair in order to scry on the party more effectively. She will be scrying on them periodically during their time in Skyreach Castle.

> I'm not so foolish as to send you on your way and spare a little prayer each night for your success. Tiamat smiles on those who *act*. So. I require a little token of your faith. Something...personal. [she looks at Declan] a little of that gorgeous hair, perhaps. We can't all be naturally blonde. If I'm to be peeking in on you from time to time, I may as well start with the best view.
> 

Talis also invites the PCs to stay the night, since they will need to be disguised and prepared to enter Skyreach.

> I'm so pleased we could do business. I know you're in a rush, and I myself am eager to set this plan in motion, but it won't do either of us any good if you're discovered as soon as you reach the castle. We need to get you cleaned up and in some reasonably convincing attire. You'll spend the night here and my servants will attend to you. In the morning, we'll get you outfitted with something more appropriate.
> 

Talis calls for Gastyn, the chief butler, and instructs him to make everything ready for the guests. Gastyn leaves without a word, clearly resentful and uncomfortable in her presence.

Talis can give the PCs some information tonight, if they happen to be persuasive in asking for it.

- Skyreach castle is a gift nearly as dear as a dragon mask, and it was given to us by a giant. One who understands the inevitability of Tiamat's return. It was built long ago by the cloud giants, and ancient and terrible magic allows it to sail the skies over Faerun. But Rezmir, fool that she is, won't use it to destroy our enemies! Instead it is a glorified treasure barge. Once you take her out of the picture and deliver me Skyreach, I'll truly put it to use.
- Several of our stronger allies are currently using Skyreach as their home. One of them you will bring to me. Snow-white Glazhael, the Cloudchaser, a handsome dragon of the pure northern breed. I've also heard that a vampire, one of the Morgias, patrols the castle day and night. And those Thayan wizards have been skulking about in Parnast lately; I wouldn't be surprised if Rezmir was bringing them on for her own pleasure.
- If you came looking for dragon masks, you're far behind. Severin found them, every one. She showed him where they were! Now the wyrmspeakers are gathering a hoard worthy of Tiamat and making preparations for her return. Severin the Red, Galvan the Blue, Neronvain the Green, Rezmir the Black...not long for this world...and that damned fool Varram, out of my reach.

The next morning, Talis instructs Kusphia to outfit the group with Dragonclaw robes, so that their faces can be concealed. She also gives them the banner in room 15, and writes and seals a note saying they are to be transported to the Sunset mountains to report to Naergoth Bladelord.

### Disagreement

If the PCs don't agree, Talis decides to have them killed.

> Fool that I was, thinking we could do business. I see you've made it this far purely on luck, because any common sense you had you clearly left back in whatever shithole towns you started from. At least you can provide Trepsin some amusement as meat dolls. Scream loud, he likes that.

Talis stays well behind her bodyguards. More reinforcements arrive during the battle:

- After one round, the Kobold servants arrive.
- After two rounds, the Gargoyles and Helmed Horror arrive.
- After three rounds, Trepsin arrives with the Ambush Drakes not far behind.

### Resolution

Whether the PCs agree to the deal or not, they level up after fighting or sleeping.
