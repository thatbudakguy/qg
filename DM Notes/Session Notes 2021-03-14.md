# Outline

It is early evening on Uktar 6.

## The Abandoned House

The abandoned building next to Bryce's shop was torched by the Welcomers, who set it alight on the night of Uktar 4, just two days ago. Bryce was woken up by shouting and an intense heat in the night, and remembers grabbing Butler and running out into the street to see what the commotion was about. He talked to one of the knights who responded to fight the fire and was told that the fire started in the abandoned upper floor and spread to the rest of the property.

The knight was evidently willing to divulge what he knew – either out of anger or commiseration –and told Bryce that the Welcomers were suspected. The knight didn't himself know what was inside the property, but assumed that the Welcomers burned it simply because it appeared important to the Fists.

If the PCs examine the wreckage, they can see that very little of the structure of the property remains. Some of the innermost parts of the living room area are intact, including some charred pieces of carpet and burnt chunks of the loom that were in here, but otherwise it's impossible to discern anything. The entire southern end of the building has collapsed on top of the kitchen area, rendering it totally inaccessible. With a DC 18 investigation check, the PCs can deduce that this was by design – someone set this fire in an attempt to make this area inaccessible, and they succeeded.

If the PCs speak to any other residents of the Steel Ave. neighborhood, none of them had conversations similar to Bryce with any of the Knights, but some did witness the fire late in the night. If the PCs speak to Alero, he was traveling to see his mother and father who have a farm to the East along the Phlan Path.

## The Welcomers

The PCs may elect to go straight to the heart of the matter and attempt to ask Glevith whether the welcomers were involved in the fire. He feigns indifference and blames the Fists for desiring to immediately pin crimes on the Welcomers to keep tensions high, but a DC 15 insight check reveals he's bluffing. If the check succeeds by more than 5, the PCs deduce that he himself ordered the fire, and by extension realize that he was pretending during their earlier conversation with him about Sahnd Krulek.

## Valhingen Graveyard

> Gravel walkways, tall trees, and well-tended beds of shrub and flowers decorate an otherwise clean and sturdy landscape of tombstones and mausoleums.
> 

Two bridges lead from Old Phlan across the Stojanow, but only one leads into Valhingen, making it an excellent way to cut off the retreat of anyone coming into the graveyard. A low stone wall surrounds the graveyard.

The grave of Peregrine Buntly, which Peregrine saw upon his arrival in Phlan and used as a name, is located here.

## The Black Fists

### Sirge Wintermelt

The young harper showed his cards over lunch on Uktar 6, and Cron responded. Though Sirge had been expecting some level of suspicion, what he got was overwhelming relief - having not heard from his cutout in over a month, Cron was desperate for any kind of sign that the plan was still game. Sirge struggled to play it cool, as he had no real news to deliver and Cron was needling for some. Sirge did manage to convince the Lieutenant that he had an "inside line" and would pass on more information as soon as he had it. He also pulled what he thought was an incredibly smart move by telling Bolver that his previous cutout had been compromised, hence the long delay.

If contacted via *sending*, Sirge is more careful with his words:

> He bought it! No info for a month. He was desperate. Told him old contact was compromised. Pretty good, right? How do I get the letter?
> 

### Lt. Cron Bolver

If surveilled again, Bolver repeats the same routine, but instead travels up to the castle to receive orders from Capt. Barrelhelm and doesn't visit the West Gate.
