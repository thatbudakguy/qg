# Outline

## Mere of Dead Men

### Night

Snapjaw and the other 9 lizardfolk he has recruited will follow the characters until they reach the castle, whenever they are ready to depart. If the group spends the night at the outpost, a few lizardfolk leave the camp to hunt and come back with frogs, fish and other small creatures to roast over the fire. They leave the roasted fish already at the camp for the "softskins".

### Day 2

In the morning or whenever the characters leave, Snapjaw and two others he hand-picks will guide the characters to the castle. The rest press on to the Roadhouse. From the campsite on, the trip to Castle Naerytar must be made by canoe. A guide isn't really necessary, because the course is marked with symbols scratched into tree trunks and totems hung from branches.

Sometime during this day, Leosin contacts the characters using *sending* to report that he and Sirge have been captured and are confined in the castle's northeast tower under lizardfolk guard. He warns them that the man wearing the hat is there, and revealed himself to be a Red Wizard as well as blowing Leosin's cover.

Hearing this, Jamna realizes that she will suffer the same fate if she's not careful. She decides to abandon the party and report back with the knowledge she has. She signs off merely with "it's been...interesting." And walks off into the Mere.

## Castle Naerytar

### Approach

Snapjaw knows where the lizardfolk pickets are posted about half a mile out from the castle. If he is with the characters, he can prevent them from blundering into a trap or an ambush. He talks to the 6 lizardfolk guards if characters let him.

Snapjaw tells the guards that the characters are great warriors come to destroy the Cult of the Dragon, and that now is the time to make their move against the bullywugs. You can either decide for yourself how the guards react to that, or make a DC 10 Charisma check for Snapjaw. If the check succeeds, the guards are persuaded. If the check fails, the characters don't impress them. They won't take action against the bullywugs now, but they won't interfere with the characters, either. If the result is 5 or lower, these guards decide Snapjaw's talk of an uprising is dangerously rash, and they attack him.

> A massive stone structure stands before you, its towers reaching into the mists of the mere. Nestled in among the crenellations, far off the ground, you can make out the glint of a metal dome bristling with telescopes and astronomical equipment. Stretching out towards you over the dark water is a several hundred-foot causeway ending in a semicircular bulkhead, a forward defensive position with commanding views of the surrouding swamp. In the shadow of the castle are dozens of low huts crowded together on the boggy ground, some almost completely submerged in water. Nearer to the raised foundation are tall reed longhouses with thatched roofs, large enough to sleep twenty or thirty humanoids. Smoke curls lazily from a chimney in one of the longhouses, and dim light flickers through the arrow slits of the castle's outer wall.

### Entering

If the characters elect to disguise themselves as cultists, Snapjaw and the other two lizardfolk will escort them through the barbican and into the castle, directing them to report to Borngray for assignment.

Borngray is inspecting the weapons that the Lizardfolk are attempting to forge. He will assume the group are new recruits from Waterdeep and enquire as to their skills so that they can be placed accordingly. He assigns them the empty room in the Northwest tower, letting them know that they will need to clear it out a bit in order to make it livable. He also tells them that the sound of three beats on the large drum in the barbican will summon them to work each morning, and two beats for the midday meal. There will be penalties for not showing up to work.
