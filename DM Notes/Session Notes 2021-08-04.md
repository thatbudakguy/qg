## Conversation with Azbara Jos

When the Gang return to their room, they find a [Note from Azbara Jos](../Handouts/%E2%9C%89%EF%B8%8F%20Note%20from%20Azbara%20Jos.md) written in a foreign, spidery handwriting.

Jos awaits the party on the first floor of the keep. As a precaution, he has cast *Mordenkainen's private sanctum* on the entire first floor of the keep, granting the following effects:

- Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.
- Sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.
- Creatures in the area can't be targeted by divination spells.
- Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.
- Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.

When the party arrive, they get their first good look at the wizard.

The Red Wizard questions them about various things:

- Who they work for
- What they know of Thay's involvement
- What they know of the Cult of the Dragon's plans
- Whether they think the Cult of the Dragon is going to succeed in bringing back Tiamat

Jos speaks freely about these topics, if asked:

- Thay has been under the dominion of powerful necromancers for centuries. Its leader, the lich Szass Tam, is a paranoid ruler who drives all who oppose him to exile or death. Thay has become an isolated pariah state, unable to achieve its former ambitions. Meanwhile, Tam experiments unceasingly in his laboratories underneath the Thaymount, the great central plateau of the country.
- He is an associate of Rath Modar, an important member of the Thayan Resurrection, an effort to unseat Tam and return Thay to its former glory.
- The Thayan Resurrection is evaluating a partnership with the New Cult of the Dragon under Severin Silrajin. The Red Wizards will lend their arcane expertise to guide the complex and difficult ritual to liberate Tiamat from Avernus, knowing that without them the ritual cannot hope to succeed, and in return Tiamat will end Szass Tam's vicegrip on Thay.
- This castle contains a portal to somewhere else, which is of interest to the Red Wizards independent of the Cult's plan. Rath Modar believes it to be an older elfgate created by the castle's original owner. Jos isn't allowed into the basement, but he knows that Rezmir or Borngray accompany every group, and suspects that they hold the key to activating the portal.

## Events of the Day

Rezmir and Dralmorrer Borngray will be at the Farseer of Illusk during the day. Rezmir wishes to use it to scry the area around the castle to see if any hostile forces are approaching, given the spies who have just managed to inflitrate it.

### Prison room

Dralmorrer Borngray heads to the prison to ask Declan to pry any potential location of Order of the Gauntlet troops out of the prisoners. He mentions that Rezmir will be using the "equipment" of the castle to look for any arriving intruders, but knowledge of where to look helps the usage of this equipment. At this point, Declan may spy his tattoos, if he hasn't already.

### Great Hall

Peregrine and Hagar, working in the great hall, will bear witness to Pharblex's arrival aboveground, Pharblex ventures aboveground during the day with his escort of 10 bullywugs to see Borngray about payment, since he hasn't been given his share of the current treasure yet. 

### Kitchen

If Rezmir detects that she has been poisoned, she immediately suspects Tharm and his two workers.
