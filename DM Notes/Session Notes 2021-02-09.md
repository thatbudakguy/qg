# Announcements

- Within a few sessions, we will be done with Act I. Act II will be shorter, and by the end of it you will likely be level 8. I will be taking a short hiatus after Act I to work on Act II. During this time, your characters will be overwintering in Phlan. Think about how you would occupy yourself during the long, cold Moonsea winter.
- Critical hit damage calculation ruling: all damage die you roll are doubled, including sneak attack damage, elemental damage, and damage from class or racial features like the Barbarian's Brutal Critical ability. This is a change from what we decided last session, but in light of how the PHB discusses crits, I think it's the fairest way to do it.
- Review of resurrection rules: revivify still requires a check, but it's not game over if you fail - it just slightly increases the DC of a resurrection ceremony later on, and prevents you from trying to revivify again. Resurrection ceremony requires a check, but significant contributions from close friends of the deceased can make it much easier.

# Outline

## Westbridge

### Bonfire

At the bonfire, Leosin approaches the group and gives Declan both the [Letter to Thalder](../Handouts/%E2%9C%89%EF%B8%8F%20Letter%20to%20Thalder.md) and the [Letter to Alandra](../Handouts/%E2%9C%89%EF%B8%8F%20Letter%20to%20Alandra.md). He apologizes for the danger he put everyone in, which he considers a great shame:

> Though this be a victory, I consider it more hard-won than Lord Neverember. I saw how close we came to losing you at the West Gate. I'm sorry for what I put you through. I think you're the only one who can judge if what you suffered was worth it. You should be the one to open these.
> 

He asks what the letters say, if Declan opens them.

### Return

The PCs can request to be returned to Denlor's Tower anytime by Eiruk. Ren will politely invite them back to stay at Roarke House for as long as they wish to remain in Waterdeep (although it'll be somewhat empty since he has business to attend to in the city and will be staying at Neverember Manor, so the only one in residence will be Madrak).

## Waterdeep

If the PCs journey back to Waterdeep, the journey takes one full day. Returning with them are the HAWKs, Al-Mandi, and Ren and Eiruk. Lara and Meloon stay behind, since Meloon has not fully recovered and Lara wishes to remain with him. Ren has business in the city, and Eiruk needs to stay with the PCs in order to transport them home.

Ask the PCs who they will ride with on this journey, and you can reuse any content from [Session Notes 2021-01-17](%F0%9F%97%92%EF%B8%8F%20Session%20Notes%202021-01-17.md). Ren and Eiruk will be subdued, and Al-Mandi will be downright somber, but the HAWKs will be talkative and excited, having just had one of their most exciting adventures.

The gang stops in Red Larch again. This time, they notice Lance Rock while snacking on their crumblecakes. Nobody knows what the rock is, but Minthra Mhandhyver of the poultry farm is happy to tell the legend of Claugilyamatar's boulder, to which virtually everyone reacts with alarm. Renaer deadpans "glad we didn't ask on the way here."
