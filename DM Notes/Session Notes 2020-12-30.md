# Outline

## Gensor's Apartment

At least one, if not both, of the guards will have returned by this time – but neither went as far as the kitchen to determine that the PCs are inside the house. They will have returned to their regular locations - Arthur in Bryce Vang's yard, and Aleksi at the front door. All actions prior to leaving the building require DC 10 stealth checks; any failures will alert one or both of the guards.

## Madame Freona's Tea Kettle

Chaab completes his work by the end of the month. He pays the party a total of 32gp whenever they come to collect at Madame Freona's Tea Kettle.

## Mantor's Library

If Declan seeks info on Claugilyamatar, he can learn up to everything in the "History" section on the wiki page: [https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Claugiyliamatar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Claugiyliamatar)

About the bard book, he can learn about the *imprisonment* spell, up to everything on its wiki page: [https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Imprisonment](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Imprisonment). Optionally also the *freedom* spell, though there is considerably less information on that and it's not clear it was ever really a thing.
