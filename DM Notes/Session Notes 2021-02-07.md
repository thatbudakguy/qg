# Outline

The session begins with the PCs reacting to Claugilyamatar's arrival. Her breath weapon has just been used, and despite its lack of effect she'll use it again in order to scare the combatants and create more chaos - even though it has deleterious effects on the Zartruss. Have everyone roll initiative in order to determine turn order. Read the following when her breath weapon is used again.

> Struggling to breathe in the choking smoke, you cry out for your friends, stumbling in the direction you think the opening in the wall might be. Humanoid figures swim up through the fog, some flailing wildly in the throes of death, falling to the ground.
> 

Claugilyamatar will act against the gang first, who she knows to have murdered both cult leaders and caused maximum havoc. She knows her poison can't hurt the gang, but that won't stop her from tearing down the rope bridge and using her claws and teeth to good effect. She will have trouble getting to the PCs if they take shelter within the courtyard, and will move to assault the main force if this happens.

Once the PCs get down to the main level of the fortress, they hear the faction leaders calling for a hasty retreat. They will see, for the first time, the HAWKs finishing off the bodies of hobgoblins and cultists littered around the Old Cult camp, with Leosin protecting them. Any leaders they encounter will shout at them to make for the trees, where Claugilyamatar can't get at them, and to find Shala if they can.

ðŸ’¡ Inform the PCs that they have three options to leave at this point: East, West, and Breach.

## Retreat

Depending on where the PCs are, they will need to find a way out with whoever is around:

- If they exit through the breach in the wall with the Enclave, Shala will use *transport via plants* to get them and whoever else is around through a tree and out back into the staging area at Westbridge. They will need to protect her and get her outside the fortress to find a tree first, however â€“Â and she will let them know that she is everyone else's ticket out. This triggers a battle once they get close enough to her, where she moves slowly but they need to protect her.
- If they go for the East gate, the Moonstars and Eiruk will be with them and can cast *expeditious retreat*, allowing them to get out and into the forest faster. He'll let them know about Shala, but whether they find her is up to them. This triggers a battle where they need to protect Eiruk, who is injured.
- If they go for the West gate, the Harpers will be locked in battle with Garbul and what remains of the Dragonclaws. They look to be outnumbered, so this triggers a battle if the PCs stop to help.

### Battle

Claugilyamatar will roll initiative to participate in whatever battle the PCs become involved in, but may not act depending on whether or not she's tied up - feel free to fudge rolls to check if she will intervene in order to add to drama.

When she does get involved, she strikes indiscriminately, often killing hobgoblins as well as coalition forces. She does make claw and bite attacks against the PCs and others; let some of these hit but feel free to fudge them into misses at crucial moments to add to the drama.

Once the PCs reach the safety of the trees, Claugilyamatar is unable to get at them, and angrily offers a parting shot:

> Miserable insects! You survive only through cowardice and deceit. Your time will come. My memory is long!
> 

Whoever they are with may urge the group to wait for more survivors so that they are not left behind, triggering a debate with someone else where the PCs will need to be the deciding factor. If they decide to go, Al-Mandi does not return from the battle. If they wait, a hobgoblin or two will appear and be shot down, but finally just as they turn to go, Al-Mandi will appear, with none of his retinue left. He will be exhausted and morose, responding monosyllabically, and remain so at the bonfire - but he lives.

## Aftermath

If they are transported by Shala, they're the first ones to make it back. The staging area is eerily empty, the tents and belongings set up just at the PCs saw them last night. A few farmers will be waiting for them, including Herivin, owner of the Harvest Inn. The locals will ask excitedly about what happened and offer the group medical attention and food if they need it. They will also be concerned for where the rest of the force is.

If they don't end up using *transport via plants*, it's a several-hour trek by foot back to the staging area. You can fake some survival checks made by other members of the group, since the PCs don't know the way back. Many of the wounded will be joining them. When they reach the staging area, the sun is just kissing the horizon, and a cold wind is blowing through Westbridge. Shala's group, who arrived first, saw to the preparations and they are greeted by a crowd of locals, who have prepared hot food and will see to the medical needs of anyone who is injured.

ðŸŽµ 1'15" or so mark in the skyrim "Tamriel Reborn" mix is good for this.

That evening, word gets around that Renaer is convening everyone for a bonfire at the staging area. The wind soon whips up a bitter cold, but the locals have assembled a huge pile of dry wood and hay, and before long a merry fire is burning on the green. Members of the assault party are passing around bottles, sharing and chatting with the locals.

> You see a group of boys, none of them older than ten, looking on in awe as a grizzled dwarf polishes the blood off of his white enameled armor. The dwarf favors the children with a broad wink and a smile and they scatter, giggling. Elsewhere, an elf with long white hair silently accepts a bottle offered by a human with a shaved head and black leather armor, gratefully tipping it back. A halfling wearing long priest's robes sits on a camp stool with his head in his hands, too deep in grief to take part in the festivities.
> 

The PCs can speak with anyone they wish.

### Renaer's speech

Renaer gathers the combatants to say a few words of thanks.

"I want to say something."

"This battle was unprecedented. Today, members the Order, the Enclave, the Alliance, the Harpers, and even the Black Network came from the Sword Coast and beyond to fight - and die - together. We found common cause against the Cult of the Dragon and their allies, and something tells me it is not the first time we will do so."

"But be assured: today, the victory was ours. The Cult's efforts to negotiate with Old Gnawbones met with disaster, their forces killed and scattered to the four winds. The dragon will think twice before lending her support to an organization that fell so swiftly to a coalition of determined actors - a coalition that I hope will continue beyond this day."

"This victory, of course, came at a price. Some who journeyed forth with us this morning will not share in the warmth of this fire and the joys of this company. I know you will spare a moment tonight to think on them, but I hope that their memory will stay with you until the next time the Cult threatens the safety of our lands. Remember them then, and in their honor answer the call."

"Thank you all."

### Ontharr's gesture

[ontharr gives order necklace to calcey] - "was always a little tight on me anyway".
