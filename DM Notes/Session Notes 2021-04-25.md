# Recap

[End of the Line](../Adventure%20Log/%F0%9F%9B%91%20End%20of%20the%20Line.md) 

- In recognition of your efforts to keep Phlan safe from forces who would threaten her safety both external and internal, the Lord Regent formally bequeathed to you Denlor's Tower, at the advice and with the permission of the Lord Sage. He did so trusting that you would continue to use it to keep the city safe, and with the understanding that you could be called upon to defend Phlan in her time of need.
- The Lord Regent also deputized all four of you as honorary Knights of the Black Fist, giving you the power to command soldiers in any scenario where your authority was not superseded by a Lieutenant or Captain. He honorably discharged Sirge from service, despite having had the shortest term of any Knight on record, at the urging of Aya Glenmiir.
- Your fame in Phlan has grown. The common folk now recognize you as the adventurers who drove out the cultists and corrupt knights who were plotting to take over Phlan, and you have attracted a small group of admirers. Marten and Vera Foss have reported that traffic to their small training facility has increased over the winter, as aspiring young folk seek to train themselves in combat to become the next Quarantine Gang.

> Just as the snows begin to thaw, glad tidings come to the people of Phlan: martial law has been lifted. With Cult of the Dragon activity largely at an end, Lord Regent Ector Brahms has rewarded the loyalty of his subjects by ending the immensely unpopular period of military rule. It is the second day of the month of Ches, and spring has come to the Moonsea.

Aya contacts Hagar with *sending* here, asking to meet them whenever they are able at her shop. She says that it's about Leosin, but doesn't say more.

## Aya Glenmiir's Shop

Whenever the PCs arrive, Aya and Sirge are both there. Sirge is trying on some fancy-looking clothes - if the PCs ask, he explains that he's getting ready to go undercover.

Aya explains that, having heard from Berdusk that Leosin was AWOL, she got worried enough to contact him via *sending* shortly afterwards. *S*he learned that he was in deep cover with a caravan traveling north from Baldur's Gate along the Trade Way, a relatively rare occurrence during deep winter but still possible further south in Faerun.

Leosin suspected the cult was involved in a major assault on the town of Greenest, and tracked the plundered goods to Baldur's Gate, where he found some shady-looking characters offering a suspiciously high pay to anyone willing to travel north. He posed as a guard in order to embed with the caravan.

Having not heard from Leosin in two weeks, she is concerned that he may have been discovered, but is also wary of blowing his cover. Because the PCs have connections to the Moonstars, she's hoping that Renaer and his friends will assist the Harpers in intercepting the caravan once it reaches Waterdeep, and making sure Leosin is unharmed when that happens. If Leosin is right and the cult is involved, whatever's going on might represent the newest shift in their plans.

Aya guesses that the caravan will arrive in Waterdeep sometime around Ches 6, but without being able to talk to Leosin she's not positive. Her plan is for the PCs to meet the caravan in waterdeep disguised as merchants [looks at Sirge], so that they can verify that Leosin is unharmed and debrief with him.

It's unclear if Waterdeep is the final destination, but if it's not, the Harpers need to know where the treasure looted from Greenest is bound. The PCs should be prepared for a potentially long trip, if they're willing to see this through.

If the PCs ask, Aya tells them that the cult convoy was supposedly led by a half-black-dragon sorcerer, someone that would certainly be impossible to miss and whom the other guards would recognize. However, it would also be highly unlikely if not impossible for the sorcerer to enter the city, so they likely won't be with the convoy.

If the PCs contact Eiruk Weskur via *sending*:

> This is concerning. I'm away from the city on Guild business, but you have the sigils - please don't hesitate to use them. I'll inform Renaer.
> 

If the PCs contact Renaer Neverember via *sending*:

> [name], good to hear from you! Come as soon as you can. I'll have Madrak prepare some rooms.

### News from Ellison

Before the PCs leave, Aya mentions that there's something else. A few days ago, she received a letter from Ellison Berenger, the notorious Scroll Thief and the former student she knew as "Sam". Evidently Ellison deeply regretted his theft of *The Weave* and wishes to apologize for his actions (although he wasn't brave enough to do it in person, which Aya calls "smart").

What Aya mainly learned from the letter is what Ellison deduced after he heard about the jailing of the traitorous Black Fists: that the messages he was ordered to deliver to a dead drop near Stojanow Gate were intended for Cron Bolver. Moreover, Ellison wanted to make amends by offering information he was privy to while working with the cult: the identity of the Red Wyrmspeaker, the "whisperer" mentioned in his note to Fulta. Ellison is confident that this man is at the top now, and though the Old Cult has been driven from Phlan, he will waste no time in consolidating power. His name is Severin.

Ellison also left a final message for Peregrine: "they know". The cult doesn't take kindly to deserters, and with the new cult seizing the reins, they will spare no effort to hunt down Peregrine. Before he got out for good, Ellison got the impression that whatever Peregrine did in Waterdeep, the Cult thinks is too important to leak. And they're willing to kill Peregrine to stop it.
