# Announcements

- "Search" action in combat - making perception/investigation checks requires your action. If it's just "do I see X thing", might not always, but I'll let you know.
- "Help" action in combat - you don't need to make a check! if it's something the DM judges you could ordinarily do (i.e. proficient at, etc) you automatically succeed.
- Interacting with *one* object or environmental thing "as you move" or act is free! Unless it specifically requires an action, or is your second one.
- Communicating with speech or gestures is always free.
