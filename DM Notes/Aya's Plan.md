# Aya's Plan

# Summary

a canary trap: leak info and see who it reaches.

find someone who can get close to bolver to pass him a message. make it a clear declaration that VG is coming on a certain date/time, or to be ready to do X. maybe that a prison break will happen.

then, set it up so that whoever hears this will take an action that clearly reveals them at the prescribed time, in a public way.
