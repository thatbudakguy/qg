# Outline

## The *Seagull's Caw*

Calvin and the rest of the crew were able to bring their ship into port successfully despite the weather, and Calvin's soft-spoken leadership during the journey home has cemented him as the captain of the ship. The rest of the crew will follow him wherever he leads.

If contacted, Calvin is back at home with his grandfather in Kabel's Hill. He has asked the rest of the crew to take a few days to see their families and collect their things, and then meet up at the Leaky Bucket on Uktar 2nd to discuss how to make the best of their new livelihood.

Calvin's plan is to use the shallow keel and oars of the longboat to their advantage, and operate a ferry service on parts of the Stojanow river over the winter while the Moonsea is impassable. After winter ends, the crew can look for opportunities to operate as independent freight haulers, plying the cities of Moonsea with whatever cargo pays the best. At any time, the QG can contact Calvin to claim their share of the profits.

## Gensor's Apartment

If it's only been a day since the gang bribed Alero, he has nothing to report, but returns Calcey's money so as not to appear to have cheated them. If it's been longer than that, he can say that the Fists seem to come by the shop at late hours to change the guard, maybe around midnight.

See [The Traitor in Purple](../Adventures/%F0%9F%8E%A9%20The%20Traitor%20in%20Purple.md) for entering the building.

## The Laughing Goblin

Imizael has their 2/3 barrel of ale at the Laughing Goblin. If they come after the tower, depending on the time, there are some drunken stragglers but the place is mostly empty.

Carrying the barrel out to Kabel's Hill (by any means, including rolling) is a DC 14 constitution check (group or individual). Failure incurs one point of exhaustion for all those who fail, but the barrel still reaches its destination.

## Kabel's Hill

The Leaky Bucket is deserted, but Grinna wakes up and comes downstairs when the gang arrives and is delighted to see that they can restock. She asks what the gang have been up to in the intervening time and if they took that contract from the strange man who visited awhile back.

She wakes up Hupe to have a celebratory nightcap since the gang have arrived bearing gifts. Hupe asks what their next move is.
