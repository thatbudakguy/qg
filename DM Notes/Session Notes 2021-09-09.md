# Recap

[The Butcher of Castle Naerytar](../Adventure%20Log/The%20Butcher%20of%20Castle%20Naerytar.md) 

# Outline

## Dungeons

- Rezmir, her escort of four dragonwings, and Azbara will be headed directly to the portal. If the PCs hide, everyone needs to beat an 11, which is the highest passive perception of the group.
- They will hear conversation as the group passes; Rezmir talking about securing the portal and Azbara talking about the battle upstairs and how they barely made it out. Rezmir reminds him that he still needs her in order to escape.
- In combat, Azbara will immediately cast *invisibility* on himself and Rezmir, and both of them will dash in the direction of the portal. If anyone is within earshot, they will hear Rezmir speak the portal's command word (*Feredir*, Elvish for "Hunter").

## The Battle

- snapjaw, the lizardfolk, leosin, and sirge go down to the dungeons. on their way down there, the lizardfolk have to fight through bullywugs and cultists. this sounds the alarm.
- once the alarm is raised, the cult leadership will initially believe that the prisoners are leading the lizardfolk mutiny, not suspecting the PCs. this will cause widespread fighting amongst lizardfolk, bullywugs, and cultists on the main floor of the castle, with the bullywugs and cultists attempting to block access to the dungeons and push the lizardfolk back to their tower.
- snapjaw will ensure that the giant lizards are set loose from the stockade, adding to the chaos and offsetting the force of the three guard drakes, one of whom is poisoned.
- Rezmir will instruct Borngray to hold the line on the first floor, and to send some of the cultists to bring bullywugs from the barbican and out of their huts for backup. these forces will arrive in the courtyard after several rounds, tipping the numbers more heavily in favor of the cult, but they may arrive too late, especially if the bullywugs are routed.
- Rezmir will be in her chambers securing her things, but as soon as the tide turns in the courtyard, she will immediately make for the portal, with an escort of dragonwings to fend off anyone who would prevent her from leaving Castle Naerytar as quickly as possible. Jos knows that she can open the portal, and he will be close on her heels.
- Caltrops at portal
