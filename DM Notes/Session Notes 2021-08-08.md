# Outline

It is currently midday. The gang have an opportunity to take care of anything they desire to do at this point before evening falls.

As the sun sets, all the cultists will gather in the great hall for the evening meal. If Calcey decides to poison Rezmir, it would take place at this point. Borngray will also approach Declan to ask what he learned during the day's interrogation. He will inform Declan that Rezmir has ordered the spies executed tomorrow morning, as their usefulness is at an end. 

After the meal, Rezmir will retire to her chambers to venerate Tiamat and to contact Severin to inform him of whatever Declan told Borngray.
