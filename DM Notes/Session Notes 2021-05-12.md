# Outline

## Caravan Court

### Caravan arrival

One or two caravans arrive each day at Caravan Court, but it takes until late in the day on Ches 5 until the caravan arrives in Waterdeep â€“Â one day before Aya predicted. Once the caravan arrives, There are a few ways that the PCs might be tipped off that this is the one:

- The caravan is much larger than most of the others that have arrived so far.
- Leosin can be spotted with a DC 20 insight check, disguised as a guard. He's wearing a rusted mail shirt and has a mustache that looks a little strange on his otherwise hairless face.
- The PCs can talk to any of the assembled guards and ask if they happen to have traveled with a half-dragon, or seen one. Guards may ask for a bribe, since they've been paid to not blab about working with Rezmir.

ðŸŽµ Start "Blunt instrument" from the Casino Royale soundtrack.

PCs might ask to inspect wagons or talk to the members of the convoy. See [https://5e-spelljammer.github.io/adventure.html#HotDQ,4,elturel](https://5e-spelljammer.github.io/adventure.html#HotDQ,4,elturel) for NPCs who are part of the caravan and what they're carrying.

Once there, all of the guards are paid and many of the wagons disperse, while the cult leaders call a small meeting near their five wagons. At this point, Leosin is paid his wages and leaves, but he will later notice the characters and reveal the fact that he's a harper to them. Jamna Gleamsilver and Azabara Jos are in attendance, along with the rest of the cult folks.

If the PCs listen in on the conversation (or ask Leosin), they learn that instead of dispersing into the Trades ward, the wagons are headed north. 

<aside>
ðŸŽµ At around 0:50, a guard walks by after being paid but then notices one of the gang and comes over. Time this reveal to 1:15 or so.
