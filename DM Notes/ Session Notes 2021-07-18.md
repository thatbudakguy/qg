# Recap

# Outline

The Otyugh Encounter happens at the beginning of the session. Afterwards, players can choose to resume their assigned duties, or take other actions until the evening meal, at which point Rezmir returns.

## Otyugh Encounter

The Otyugh is acting in the surprise round and has successfully grappled Hagar with one tentacle. It will attack with the other tentacle (with advantage, since Hagar is restrained) and the damage from that attack (if it hits) should be added to 5 to form the DC of a constitution saving throw for Hagar to hold his breath when being pulled under. On a success, he can hold his breath for a number of minutes equal 1 + his Con modifer, for a total of 3 minutes or 30 rounds. On a failure, he can hold his breath for 2 minutes or 20 rounds.

After the Otyugh finishes its attacks, Hagar is up immediately (no need to roll initiative since no one else is involved). The Otyugh will switch to bite attacks after it pulls Hagar under the surface, and attack any intruders using its tentacles.

The Otyugh's name is "Big Mouth", for obvious reasons (and because the words are intelligible to the Lizardfolk and Bullywugs alike).

### Joining the Fight

Once other members of the Gang are alerted, it takes them some time to reach the fight:

- Peregrine, in the Great Hall, can get to the Northwest tower in three rounds
- Calcey, in the Kitchen, can get to the Northwest tower in four rounds
- Declan, in the Northeast tower, can get to the Northwest tower in five rounds

If Hagar intentionally makes noise, lizardfolk (including Snapjaw) can be on the scene in two rounds, since the Guard Drakes will alert them that something is amiss in the Northwest tower. 

## Rezmir's Return

While the cultists are taking their evening meal, Rezmir returns from her visit to Voaraghamanthar.

> A tall, regal humanoid in gold-trimmed purple robes whirls into the room, her massive scaly head dominated by two curling horns. At her side is an impossibly long, wicked blade serrated on both sides, with a curling guard and pommel glittering with a dark purple gem. Her presence fills the room, and the conversation dies almost immediately. She makes a sign with all five fingers extended, which is immediately returned by the black-clad cultists sitting at the head of the table. "Borngray...my office." She turns and exits without another word.
> 

Borngray motions to Declan impatiently for him to accompany the Elf up to Rezmir's chambers.

> You follow Borngray out of the Great Hall and into the Inner Ward, before re-entering the castle via a different door on the Southern wall. Inside is a small room, clearly once consecrated as a chapel, now repurposed as a shrine to Tiamat. A carved wooden statue of the dragon goddess sits atop a table in one corner, candles burning around her five writhing heads. Borngray leads you impatiently through the room into another, crowded with small beds and trunks of belongings, ascending the stairs inside. You emerge above chapel into a library, its aging shelves crammed with books, even more spilling out onto the floor and hastily arranged around trunks and boxes. Borngray continues his ascent, and finally you reach the third floor of the Southeast tower. The furnishings here are notably nicer than elsewhere in the Castle, prominently featuring a mahogany writing desk stacked with paper and several ornate wooden chairs. Two matched onyx carvings of black dragons flank the top of the staircase.
> 

Borngray politely inquires after the health of the Black Death.

She asks Borngray if it's possible they had only come for the Farseer and didn't know the cult was here. Borngray says Declan should explain what happened. 

Rezmir's questions for Declan:

- Are the prisoners a threat to her operations at the castle?
- Rezmir sizes up Declan to see if he is who he claims to be
- Rezmir decides whether to allow Declan to continue the interrogation, take over herself, or leave the captives alone
