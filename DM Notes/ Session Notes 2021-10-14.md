# Warmup

This is a new thing I'm trying! We will answer a question in character. At the end, you (and me) will choose someone who receives inspiration for their roleplaying. You don't have to do it in your character's voice, but it might help!

This week's question:

❓ In your character’s opinion, what quality should EVERY adventurer have?

# Outline

## Observatory

### Gargoyle Battle

This is a ToTM fight since it's very close-quarters. People can get hurled out of the building!

The gargoyles attack characters from smallest to largest stature in pairs of two, doing nonlethal damage on the final blow in an attempt to knock out their quarry for later torture. They use their flying speed to make dive-bombing attacks. They're resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical weapons.

They don't respond to any speech that isn't in Terran. They flee when reduced to 10hp or when only one gargoyle remains.

### The Farseer

Understanding how the farseer operates requires a DC 15 Arcana check. A character who succeeds learns that this device requires both arcane aptitude and a steady, practiced hand. They also determine that it can be used in the manner of an *arcane eye* spell, with a range of about 50 miles. Any character can also find this information in Rezmir's notes with a DC 10 investigation check.

Peregrine surmises that, given the shape the device is in, failure to use it cautiously could damage it, and similarly attempting to extract it is a lost cause: in the shape it's in, a team of brass-smiths and artificers would be lucky to remove it without damage given a week to work.

Thereafter, using the Farseer requires both a DC 15 Arcana check and a DC 15 Sleight of Hand check from the same character. If the sleight of hand check fails by more than 5, a part of the device breaks off and renders it inoperable.

If the characters operate the Farseer, they discover Voaraghamanthar's lair:

> Swirling mists surround a huge earthen mound, partially submerged into the swamp water.
