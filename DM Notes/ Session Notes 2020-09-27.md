Xandria Welltran

- was a green dragon named Raaxil who often appeared polymorphed as a beautiful woman. incredibly vain and warped by greed.
- infiltrated the council of Ten of Phlan around 1340 DR
- was in league with Gensor, court mage hired by Porphyrys Cadorna.
- Gensor was a rogue Wearer of Purple who was preparing to transform Raaxil into a dracolich in secret in a bid to gain control of the Cinnabar Throne. He believed he could control Raaxil through her vanity and greed - and in the meantime, she would fund his experiments to independently discover the secret of dracolich creation.
- Raaxil created space for the laboratory to be built under the guise of establishing a lavish mausoleum for herself in Valhingen. Nobody looked twice at this because at the time Valhingen was infested with undead and generally not a great place
- Gensor requested that Raaxil create a space with ample room for his twisted experiments, which included creating human-dragon fusion creatures on which to "test" the procedure. All of the chambers of the crypt were infused with preservation magic so that Gensor's experiments would "live" longer, which is why the corpses have not fully decayed. She also supplied an endless stream of humans, lizardfolk, and other dragonkin via her powerful position for the "experiments".
- In return for Gensor's playground, the mage created a "throne" for Raaxil to sit on and contemplate her dominion over Phlan. The exceedingly vain dragon was not content to wait for the Cinnabar throne, and preferred to play-act.
- Gensor preferred to enter and exit the crypt via a teleportation circle, which is linked to one in a recently uncovered basement of an older property (now vacant) in what is now New Phlan. the Welcomers recently accidentally discovered it and were able to determine where it leads, hoping to use it to plunder Valhingen in secret. Using the circle successfully requires a DC 20 arcana check.
- When Gensor completed his research, Xandria arranged to "die" by drinking a potion that would make her feign death so she could be delivered to the mausoleum. The gas trap was created to deter any would-be grave robbers, since Xandria was rumored to be fabulously wealthy. Xandria was "interred" in 1348 DR, the Year of the Spur - however, Valhingen would not be transferred into the care of the Order of the Silent Shroud until 1375 DR, and thus there was no formal record of her burial.
- Inside the tomb, Gensor ultimately betrayed Xandria: his research complete, he fed her a potion that killed her stone dead, adding her bones to the sarcophagus to complete the illusion.
- unknown to Glevith, the Lord's Alliance have a mole inside the Welcomers - Chaab, the Zhent fence who is often found at Madame Freona's along with Glevith. The Zhent simply found more coin in the pockets of the Alliance, and didn't think twice. The information about the Welcomers took awhile to work its way to Brother Keefe, however.
