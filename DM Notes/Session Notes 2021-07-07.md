## Meeting the Captives

### Getting There

As Borngray sizes up Declan, you can describe the elf: his shoulder-length hair is platinum blonde, and his thin face would be beautiful if it wasn't scarred in a long diagonal line. The right eye is hidden by a black leather patch, and the left flicks over Declan in an unsettling way. Borngray switches to Elvish:

> "Tiamat welcomes all who venerate the rightful rulership of dragons...I have more exacting standards. Your blood is mixed with that of a human. Is it too much to hope that you speak the tongue of our fathers?"
> 

If Declan shows some competency with Elvish, Borngray comments that he may be of some use after all (unlike the two disgusting specimens captured yesterday), and asks him to follow Declan. They exit the Forge and enter the first floor of the Northeast tower, where lizardfolk are lounging on rush mats and a few are drilling in the main area. Borngray here comments about his attempts to teach the Lizardfolk how to forge weapons.

Leading Declan up the stairs, Borngray appears in front of a chamber with two well-muscled Lizardfolk posted out front. He pauses in front of the door to tell Declan about Rezmir hearing about "spies" infiltrating the Roadhouse, and those same spies being exposed yesterday. He says that he asked some of the Bullywugs to prepare the "spies" for interrogation, but that Declan will be given first crack at them, in order to prove himself. Borngray wishes to know:

- Who the spies are working for
- How they found the castle
- What they know about the Cult operation

### Interrogation

Before Declan begins the interrogation, Borngray order the lizardfolk to open the door so that he can taunt the captives. Declan gets a view of a dirty and bruised Sirge and Leosin. Sirge appears mostly unhurt but incredibly dirty; Leosin is in bad shape: he's cradling his arm as though it is badly hurt (this is a ruse).

Borngray taunts the captives in Elvish:

> They're quite like animals, really. No better than dogs. If the Wyrmspeaker herself hadn't told me they were spies, I'd scarcely believe it. All yours.
> 

## Cleaning the Room

### Getting There

Calcey, Declan, and Hagar will be heading back to their new quarters. Borngray will direct Snapjaw to take them to the Southwest tower. To get there, they will travel back through the outer ward and enter the inner ward, getting their first glimpse of the guard drakes on patrol there. Snapjaw instructs them not to tarry too long lest they be questioned.

> As the last rays of sunlight succumb to the oily darkness of the swamp, Snapjaw leads you back out into the outer ward. Most of the Lizardfolk trainers and their mounts have cleared out, leaving just a few sullen bullywugs lounging in the shadows. Snapjaw makes for the rear of the large open space in the castle's center, passing through a fifteen-foot-tall set of wooden double doors that have long since fallen off their hinges and lie rotting on the ground. In the castle's inner ward, the light of oil lamps reveals a squat reptilian creature the size of a horse, its powerfully muscled body clambering over in your direction. Snapjaw pauses as the creature shuffles up to you, its huge dragonlike head extended. After a moment the creature turns away, seemingly losing interest, and Snapjaw beckons you onward.
> 

PCs may wish to discern the nature of these creatures. Drakes are rare outside of cult usage, so it is a DC 18 nature check to do so. Peregrine has advantage on this check owing to his potential exposure to some cult literature on their creation and usage. A successful check learns that drakes are draconic creatures distantly related to wyverns, often kept near humanoids as guard or hunting animals. Peregrine may also remember that the cult breeds its own kinds of drakes through a special magical ritual, which requires the scales and consent of a real dragon.

Snapjaw leads the group to another door that opens into the Great Hall, where at this hour no one is eating but a few Dragonwings are picking through the recent haul, most of which is still laid out on the tables (sans the portion that Rezmir is transporting to Voaraghamanthar). Calcey's astute eyes note the presence of the treasure and the fact that much of the load carried north from the Greenfields is represented here, although perhaps not all. Peregrine recognizes the costumes worn by the Dragonwings, who also carry ornate scimitars. These ones seem specifically to be clad in black dragon imagery, including pauldrons that resemble curling horns.

Snapjaw hurries the group through the Great Hall and into the Southwest tower antechamber.

> Swamp water seeps into this chamber through a crack in the foundation to pool inches deep on the sagging stone floor and fill the air with a cloying, moldy stink. The cultists have laid a walkway of planks across the floor so they can walk between the two doorways without soaking their feet.
> 

Once Snapjaw takes the group into the tower, he points out the stairs leading down to the subterranean floors, noting the "frog warrior" is often there. He then points out the door to their new quarters and excuses himself to go eat.
