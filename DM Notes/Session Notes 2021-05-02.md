## Roarke House

<aside>
ðŸŽµ Put on a crackling fire ambience and switch to the Roarke House scene.

</aside>

When the PCs arrive, Meloon is sitting in a large velvet-lined chair next to a crackling fire in the great room of Roarke House, with its stealthy teleportation circle bolted to the wooden floor. Azuredge is laid out across his lap, and he appears to have nodded off. As the PCs dust themselves off, he pretends to have been awake and greets them happily, calling for Renaer. Lord Neverember appears after a brief moment and asks who Sirge is. He then asks the PCs to come to his study with "So, what trouble are we getting ourselves into this time?"

Ren asks about the situation at hand. If the PCs ask about acquiring disguises, he recommends Ragathan's Furriers. He also asks about how long they'll stay, and assumes it'll be a few days â€“ potentially longer, if the goods remain in the city and need to be traced. About intercepting the caravan, the most likely place to start would be the aptly named Caravan Court, a popular place for caravans to form and disband on the border between the Trades Ward and the South Ward.

## Caravan Court

### Scoping it out

The PCs can learn the following by talking to people/asking around:

- The half-dragon was seen south of Waterdeep a few days ago, traveling with a strong mounted escort and headed north (true).
- Lady Silverhand is a vampire who drinks the blood of the orphans of waterdeep in order to remain young (completely false).
