# Scary Larry

Date: September 9, 2020

- The gang strikes a bargain with the remaining Black Fist knight: if he tells them which key goes to the cage inside the Funhouse, they'll let him swim for his freedom.
- Taking up defensive positions, the gang readies for a fight as Calcey sneaks into the funhouse with keys in hand. Sighting Villonah in the crumbling remains of a grand ritual chamber, Calcey nears the cage and just gets it unlocked when she is seized from behind by a powerful tentacle.
- As the horrifying beast of the funhouse attempts to devour Calcey, the rest of the Gang rush in to help out. They quickly find that the beast is easily a match for any of them, dishing out hefty damage from its razor tentacles and sharp beak.
- As Declan takes up a position to let fly a ranged spell attack, one of the mysterious obelisks in the chamber emits a pulse of arcane energy that fills him with fear. Meanwhile, Hagar slugs it out with the monster using his trusty battleaxe and Peregrine conjures a staff of spiritual energy.
- The gang manage to hold off the monster just long enough for a revived Calcey to spirit Villonah out of the cage, with Peregrine's help. The young gnome is clearly suffering from severe traumatic stress and resists attempts to touch or move her anywhere.
- Realizing he finally has the upper hand, Hagar stands his ground and finishes off the tentacled horror. The gang emerge from the Funhouse, only to find themselves in the crosshairs of a mysterious Elven interloper with a longbow who seems to have come to collect Villonah.
