# Areas
## Entrance
- very cold, very dry air. about ten miles underground.
- how are you making light?
- do you have warm clothes?
- taking stock of water and food
- strong _faerzress_: weave undulates and ripples; teleportation and other magic is dangerous
- a passage through a crevice, with walls sloping up above you. occasionally breaks into open caverns with cairns marking path.
- large stone trapezoidal archway with "ONLY THE MAD PASS THIS WAY" written around its edge in undercommon, enters long tunnel
## Stairs
- absolutely frigid in here, and change in the air: vast, open space.
- darkness presses in on you, as though light can barely push it back. you get the sense it is _hungry_ for light
- simple, 10-ft wide ledge along an endless abyss. no rail, nothing.
- if a coin or similar lit object is tossed down, you lose sight of it after about 30sec. no sound.
- following the ledge, every five miles or so you come to a simple trapezoid-shaped "landing" that extends out, with stairs that go down against the wall. the stairs are cut into a sort of sloping notch and are about one foot tall. countless steps have worn them down in the middle.
- Batu: "we're on the side of a mountain miles high...but it's as silent as a tomb..."
### Whispers
- "so lonely...i'm all alone now..."
- "come closer...let me see your face..."
- "warm...so warm...i need to feel it..."
### Encounter
- you hear faint rustling, and thin wheezing sounds, far away but gradually getting closer
- darkvision eventually sees a gnome, sick or injured, moving slowly
- gray skin svirf, short legs and long arms, bald. bloody bruises on knees and elbows. he continues moving them ineffectually, staring at nothing, whispering to himself
- he speaks a little common, a little dwarvish (duergar), and undercommon. Galdindormm is his name. "why you help me?"
- odd deep laugh. "why would surface-dwellers come to Lorosfyr? can you not hear the whispers in the dark? leave while you still can."
- "lorosfyr, the name of this vault. the maddening dark. many days across, many days around. it is cursed"
- "ten thousands steps i have climbed, crawling on my hands, but i can still hear her calling me back. do not let me listen to her! do not let me go back!!"
- "selydra, the pale queen...sybil of the deep...she will drink you."
- he eventually falls asleep. while asleep, his limbs move on their own unless he is restrained. he does not wake from this sleep, and dies quietly.
## Guard Post
- after descending for an unknown period of time, you come to a much larger landing, with squat stone buildings and a large alcove that goes back into the rock. there are four or five such buildings, in a trapezoidal shape like bunkers, with strange geometric designs carved precisely into their outlines. they are the right size for human occupation, but completely empty.
- if you sleep here and everyone consumes rations, and some source of heat is created, you can long or short rest without penalty. otherwise, everyone needs to make a DC 15 CON check to avoid becoming exhausted.
### Discoveries
- ancient murals carved into a freestanding slab, depicting the flight of imaskari wizards underground and the creation of their artificial sun. the depictions have a strange two-dimensional, angular quality, like egyptian tomb paintings. the imaskari penchant for extradimensional spaces is apparent. there seem to be two kinds of people, one of which are depicted as slightly darker-skinned and without much hair, serving a slave-like role. the other are tall, long-haired people wearing robes and many bangles and other forms of jewelry. fully half the mural is given over to a depiction of the great sun-light. text on it is written in the extinct Roushoum language.
### Encounter
- Calcey is woken up from the total blackness of slumber by the faint sound of rocks cracking together. Something is close by, only a few feet away. You hear it move, then stop, almost like it's holding its breath. it's right outside the doorway.
- Movement or anything else will result in the cave giant taking in a breath, because it sees you moving - its face is pressed right up to the door, 3ft tall, glittering black eyes on pallid, flabby skin. Light will make it groan in pain and shield its eyes.
- The giants stick hands in to try to grab the players, but may come away with items instead. Frustrated, they will eventually rip the roof off the room and simply go to town with their hands.
- Giants that survive a strong attack or magic will use their scream. Physical attacks strangely don't cause them to make much noise, just huffing-type sounds.
- After the encounter, Selydra's divination beacon (a small white sphere) slowly ascends the stairs to see what the commotion was about. It studies the party, then leaves.
