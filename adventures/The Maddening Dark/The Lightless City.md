# Areas
visible from afar: lights of the pillars, city extending on a huge shelf out into the blackness. stairs continue down below

## Terraces
- stairs descend through terraces that overlook the city
- bare skeletons of apple trees, pale and leafless. bark has desiccated and crumbles at the touch
- planted in orderly rows extending hundreds of yards to each side, stretching out into the darkness
## Streets
- squat, flat-topped pyramid like towers and buildings; intricate geometric patterns in the stonework
- weak, gray light emitted from pillars capped by crystal spheres with some kind of luminescent liquid
- plazas and squares with mosaics set into the ground (green/white/purple tile), which are dormant portals
### Encounters
- giants will appear but won't engage; will beckon the group to follow to the palace
## Palace of the Pale Sybil
- large, rambling building. front has a row of columns carved into human warriors, looking out over the city
- guards posted to the palace front are dressed somewhat similarly to the statues, except life-size and barely moving. probably 10-15.
- interior: columns of marble veined with gold; flowering vines made from metal that hold low-burning lanterns
### Throne Room
#### Selydra
- reclining on her dais. flawlessly white skin. appears to be a human woman of indeterminate age, quite small. long, black, straight hair with kimono-like gown. pupilless eyes.
- holds black platinum rod (rod of absorption) in her lap.
- greets party (D in particular) and offers refreshment; Long Stair is a difficult path. wants to hear about world above. how did you come? where are you from? etc.
	- she has heard of some places, but never traveled...library here is not very complete
- food: dark slices of meat of some kind, small salty eyeless fish, coarse grey bread, small dark blood-red fruits. dark wine; cold & pure water.
- she can explain her theory about the place re: the sun, and how it was created. how it became what it is now...unclear. spells just failed? no record of it.
- explains about entity here that consumes life and magic; that's why the swordwights are lifeless: they got consumed. selydra learned how to shield herself from its...attention. it is alive, and it hungers...it consumes victims so slowly that it is too late for them before they know what's really happening. the second shard might finally be enough to end its hunger, or at least keep it truly dormant for centuries.
	- if you can give something of comparable value, or accept a geas to get it, then she'll trade.
- if an impasse occurs, she invites declan to the table alone (to consider her own...needs).
- re: the shard; she knows it separates. thus hard to imagine that if she lent you the shard, you'd get it back.
- asks to let them rest before negotiating anything. is fairly peaceable, says can negotiate later re: crystal. knows they have one.
- lorosfyr is dangerous! if you _must_ go out, her warriors will escort you. don't go where they tell you not to.
### Apartments
- large circular beds, comfortable but dusty, with dry and dusty sleeping furs
- ornate golden lanterns, so it's lit, but still super cold.
### Courtyard
- _sussur_ tree (makes the whispers), grows on _faerzress_, produces small blood fruits
- mosaic on the ground that is a clue to the portal network
- trapezoidal portal at one of the exits, which differs from the other doors, and is an active portal

TODO: reanimated warrior stats
- creaky leather, pitted and rusted bronze
TODO pale giant stats?

Selydra stats: adapt Vampire? Mummy Lord? Demilich?
- mist form (vamp); can also teleport
- opens with mind-affecting spells; counterspells when she can, absorbs what she can't. disintegrate?
- does her _inhale_ special attack to drink souls; consumes spell slots of a caster
- if you harm or cast against yourself when she is drinking you, it will immediately break the effect and hurt her
- teleports or mists away when damaged. reappears to defend the shard
- sphere of annihilation

"Not since I consumed the archmage Talthonn have I tasted one like you!"
### Lower floors
- studded with soul pits
- contains the crystal sanctum ,with locked iron box on a pedestal in a room with five pits around the edges
- entrance door to crystal sanctum has a magic trap, but it's clearly visible
- touching/opening the crystal box summons...a goristro!
