# The Tortured Land
Wind howls through strange rock formations and pillars, echoing weirdly off of the barren plain. Small, gnarled trees and bushes dot the landscape under a heavy gray sky.

When the PCs arrive, one of them can tell they're being observed by a druid from the Ondonti Village.
The tracks of the DRs are also faintly visible, leading to the Ondonti Village.
The tracks of the Orcs are clearly visible and more recent, leading to the Bloody Hand Stronghold.
The GKC "pings" in the direction of the Frozen Garden, but eventually it just seems to point straight down, even though there's nothing around.
# Moments
- weird beasts chase each other amongst the rock formations, their cries echoing in the wind
- underdark monsters that shouldn't be here, laying dead on the surface
- a freezing dust storm
- an open fault line, with lava just below the surface bubbling up and emerging
- a wild magic or dead magic zone
## Wild Magic zones
https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/83y1x2/wild_magic_zones_and_effects/
- weave is undulating and bouncing like a stormy sea
- huge growths of strange plants
- patterns of light and colors ripple across the ground
- moving shadows with nothing to cast them
- hair lifts up and drifts on the breeze, static arcs from fingertips
- seeing things that aren't there
## Dead Magic zones
- weave appears ripped and shredded; tendrils of it drifting lazily at the edges
- declan's robe appears pitch-black; the stars wink out
- curran: "it's cold in here..."
- light goes out of magic weapons
- strange feeling in the pit of your stomach
# Props
## Ondonti Village
- A collection of primitive structures built into depressions and shapes in the rock
- Sculpted wood and stone irrigation system that pumps water from wells out into fields of green shoots
- Tall, broad-shouldered orcs in simple tunics moving in rows, sowing seeds for onions and potatoes
- A crew of orcs with sledgehammers chanting in common as they break the rock to create space for a new field
### Characters
- Henka, a druid of Eldath, sister of Gorga, very old with yellowed tusks. Has only one arm because she held on to her sister and a warrior cut it off. One of the remaining five members of the Eldathyn Circle. Knew that Hagar ("The Prodigal") would return because Gorga told her she had had a dream before Uzgat came to the village.
- Bakos and Nyri, a young couple engaged to be married on Greengrass, in about a month.
### Discoveries
- at a communal monument honoring the victims of the orc raid (a pile of broken and rusting swords), the graves of Gorga and Dovydas, with a plaque that reads: "To the wanderer who stayed, Dovydas of the Varm. To his loving wife, Gorga of the Ondonti. And to their children, Cirulis and Ilza. Lost but not forgotten. Dedicated this tenthday of Leaffall, 1490 DR."
- The _Tarek-Passar_, the way of Peace. The story of how thirty of their kind were brought as children to this realm by "The Founders" more than a thousand years ago and raised in the faith of Eldath by a multiracial society who lived in a great city. The city was destroyed nine hundred years ago in a war, and since then the Ondonti have continued as stewards of the land.
- Any Ondonti can explain what pleases Eldath, which will help with the Trial of Peace when meeting Xaritus.
- Henka knows that the Bloody Hand tribe, who raided their settlement, used to be led by the shaman Uzgat. But the Blind Fury, who leads the Bloody Hand now, is someone or something else. The wind has whispered foul things to her about this creature, stories from beyond our world. It is something older and hungrier, and it has come to the village more than once since the raid that killed Hagar's parents.
## Ruins of Myth Ondath
THE DRs KNOW ABOUT THE CHOSEN; THEY WANTED THE SUNHEARTH SOULGEM BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED THE GATEKEEPER'S CRYSTAL WAS USELESS IN PARTS BUT THE TOPAZ GRANTED ETERNAL LIFE (IF USED CORRECTLY TO CHEAT DEATH) â€“ WISH?
### Discoveries
- strange underdark monsters roaming
### Dangers
- wild magic zones
- dead magic zones
## The Hidden Garden
Once a celestial with ambitions to command an army against the hordes of Avernus, Xaritus was incarnated as an Androsphinx and engaged to serve as a tutor and interlocutor to the mortals of Myth Ondath, to teach them the values of Eldath and to learn for himself the meanings of stillness, peace, and selflessness.

Despite having foreknowledge of Iraclea's plot to destroy the City, Xaritus was forbidden by Eldath from interfering in the war, and instead instructed only to preserve her grove and hide it from the army. Eldath saw that Iraclea's brashness would prove her undoing; the inexpert use of the crystal tore holes in the weave and did not eradicate the entire city, but it did wipe out her army as well as her general Vrandak.

If the Gang seek the Crystal, Xaritus can take them there through the portal, but they must prove themselves worthy. Xaritus can move the Garden almost anywhere he chooses, by moving the world _around_ the portal: the portal "matches" another portal somewhere in the world.
### Xaritus's Trials
#### The Trial of Stillness
Night falls in the garden, the bobbing flowers and humming insects grow still.

> First you must prove yourselves worthy of understanding the smallest of her domains. You violated it merely by entering my garden. It is so delicate that even a common beast may shatter it, yet given time it always returns to its strength. Name this domain.

"Silence" or "Stillness" is what Xaritus is looking for.
#### The Trial of Peace


> The Mother of Waters is the personification of peace. She is the breaker of chains, the unmaker of weapons, and the keeper of promises to tend and heal. Make an offering that pleases her.

Eldath is pleased by:
- the sundering of weapons
- the renouncing of grudges and ill will
- apologies and pledges to improve the self
- commitment to the earth and the maintenance of groves
#### The Trial of Selflessness
The garden transforms into a sweltering cavern, veins of lava seething in the walls and heating the blackened ground.

> The dedication of the Green Goddess to her community and her ideals is beyond the selfish heroism of mortals. Her presence founded an entire city based on mutual understanding. You seek the same item as these five would-be plunderers. Find common ground.

Xaritus may activate the lava.
## Bloody Hand Stronghold
Current hideout of Tyranthraxus, controlling Uzgat's former body (now undead). 
There is a Pool of Radiance here.
