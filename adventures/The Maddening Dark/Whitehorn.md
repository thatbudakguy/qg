# Whitehorn
``` Title Goal
Cross the White Peaks into the Tortured Land.
```
The smell of smoke reaches you long before the settlement comes into view.

This simple mining town was ravaged by the warband of the Bloody Hands tribe nine days ago. Since the death of its leader Narle Shieldbiter at the hands of Hagar, the remnants of the Burning Banner tribe joined the Bloody Hands, swelling their ranks to a fearsome size.

Uzgat, formerly the warchief of the Bloody Hands (and now host to Tyranthraxus), spurs the warband around the Tortured Land and beyond, seeking in vain the Gatekeeper's Crystal in order to free himself from his extradimensional prison forever.

# Moments
- A field of onions and spinach in alternating rows, rotted from lack of harvest and beset with flies.
- A human arm with bone showing in several places, pinned to a wooden door with a dagger.
- A hot wind howls off The Ride and picks up embers, moving them onto a thatched-roof house.
# Props
## The Bowshot Moon Tavern
A mostly intact rustic tavern with the distinct smell of charred flesh and hair. The Bloody Hand dined here after effectively barbecueing many of their victims. Chairs are overturned and cheap ale is spilled everywhere.

**Levi**, a 16year old human boy with a dirty blonde rattail who was the cook and assistant manager of the Moon, has barricaded himself in the storeroom downstairs. When the PCs enter he cautiously emerges with a crossbow and threatens to shoot Calcey.

Levi saw a strange-looking Orc with many tattoos and gray skin wearing a headband that covered his eyes get carried into the tavern, through a gap in the floorboards. He doesn't speak orcish, but he remembers some of the Helmwatch priests talking about "the blind chief" once over a meal. Levi thinks the Orcs were looking for something: they ransacked the town and brought many pieces of glass and crystal here, only to abandon them. That's abnormal behavior.
### Discoveries
- the cellar is still full of food, which would be extremely beneficial to the monks at helmwatch house.
- the pile of discarded glass objects contains a well-crafted crystal decanter worth 25gp.
- the inn's records mention a Varm man named Dovydas who stayed there nearly 20 years ago, who left after a few days planning to find a passage through the White Peaks. He believed that the volcanic Underdark rifts extended through the mountains, creating a "warm route" that was passable.
- levi knows that Orcs sometimes come down from the mountains from "the other side", though no one knows how such a thing is possible: all mining expeditions that tried to find a pass never returned, and the people gave up decades ago.
### Dangers
- shards of glass from broken and discarded objects
## Helmwatch House
A fortified lookout tower and temple sporting mounted ballistae atop Old Jaw, a huge hill in the center of town. Corpses litter the ramparts. The priests fought the Bloody Hand to a standstill here, but were starved out until the Orcs tired of waiting for them to open the gates. Only a handful of priests still live, and they are too weak to leave.

If the PCs approach, **Josiah** will rasp out a query in a hoarse, near-broken voice. He is delirious and won't let anyone in unless they approach with food. Once he smells food, he will slide open the deadbolt and promptly collapse. He is wearing his everbright full plate, but his plumed helmet rests next to him. A javelin protrudes from his side.

Josiah occasionally mutters phrases like "keep my path in your unfettered gaze, lord" and "i shall not err if you are watching me, lord". He will recognize the Shieldbiter Heirloom, having defended Whitehorn from the Burning Banner and Narle Shieldbiter years ago. He knows that once the Orcs broke their siege, they celebrated at the Bowshot Moon before they left.

Josiah also knows that the Orcs were led by a warchief with whom he was not familiar, someone from beyond the White Peaks: an outsider. The scouts who made it back alive to warn the town of his coming described him as a strange, pale-skinned orc who was completely blind. Any Orc corpses who are revived know that they served the Blind Fury, who ordered them to cross the White Peaks and plunder the Ride. They also know how to get across the Peaks: follow the Harlthorn bushes, which only grow where the soil is warm enough.
### Discoveries
- several finely worked holy symbols of Helm (gauntlets) worth 50gp each
- everbright full plate armor: once per day you can make sunlight emanate 30/60ft. CON save blind.
### Dangers
- severed heads of townspeople, which the Orcs catapulted over the ramparts into the lookout tower as a scare tactic
- a collapsing section of roof, damaged by orc projectiles: 4d6 bludgeoning, DC 15 dex save for half
## Extras
### Traps
- sacks of flour inside a bakery explode, dealing 6d6 damage to those nearby (DC 15 dex save for half) 
- hidden pit traps with spikes that were not triggered by the Orc warband (2d6 bludgeoning + 2d6 piercing, DC 15 dex save negates)
### Treasures
- a fine set of silver dining ware and 75gp, secreted down a well by a fleeing family
- an Orc corpse with incense used for _speak with dead_ next to it (left by the Doom Raiders, who passed through here five days ago)
