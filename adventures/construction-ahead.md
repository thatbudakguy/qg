# Adjustments

This adventure begins in Waterdeep, where the gang are sent to await the arrival of the caravan of looted treasure. They could be assigned to spy on the caravan once it arrives to determine its final destination. It's also possible that Leosin embedded himself within this caravan (or allowed himself to be captured by it) and is going to meet the characters once it reaches Waterdeep.

You can use material suggested for the prior HoTD adventure, On the Road, to introduce the characters in the caravan and make things slightly more interesting on the journey north to the Mere of Dead Men. Many events could play out over the course of this 10-day, 200-mile journey. Obviously, the characters will need to use stealth in order to remain undetected.

The main set piece for this adventure is the Carnath Roadhouse, where the PCs end up once the journey north ends. Multiple stealthy episodes may play out here, and a TTS map may or may not be necessary to help heighten the tension. The cultist duel may also be a fun excuse for a fight, and the characters may get close to Jamna.

# Intro

The adventure begins with [aya-glenmiir](../npcs/aya-glenmiir.md) contacting the PCs to let them know that [leosin-erlanthar](../npcs/leosin-erlanthar.md) is in trouble and needs their help. She got worried enough to contact him via *sending* and learned that he was in deep cover with a caravan traveling north from Baldur's Gate along the Trade Way, a relatively rare occurrence this time of year. Leosin suspected the cult was involved in a major assault on the town of Greenest, and tracked the plundered goods to Baldur's Gate, where he found some shady-looking characters offering a suspiciously high pay to anyone willing to travel north. He posed as a guard in order to embed with the caravan.

Aya contacts the PCs with *sending* and asks them to come to her shop on Ches 2, having not heard from Leosin in two weeks. She is concerned that he may have been discovered, but also wary of blowing his cover. Because the PCs have connections to the Moonstars, she's hoping that [renaer-neverember](../npcs/renaer-neverember.md) and his friends will assist the Harpers in intercepting the caravan once it reaches Waterdeep, and making sure Leosin is unharmed when that happens. If Leosin is right and the cult is involved, whatever's going on might represent the newest shift in their plans.

Aya guesses that the caravan will arrive in Waterdeep sometime around Ches 6, but without being able to talk to Leosin she's not positive. It's unclear if Waterdeep is the final destination, but if it's not, the Harpers need to know where the treasure looted from Greenest is bound. The PCs should be prepared for a potentially long trip, if they're willing to see this through.

# Waterdeep

### Meeting the Caravan

The PCs can learn the following by talking to people/asking around:

- The half-dragon was seen south of Waterdeep a few days ago, traveling with a strong mounted escort and headed north (true).
- Lady Silverhand is a vampire who drinks the blood of the orphans of waterdeep in order to remain young (completely false).
- 

The Caravan arrives at Caravan Court midday on Ches 5. Once there, all of the guards are paid and many of the wagons disperse, while the cult leaders call a small meeting near their five wagons. At this point, Leosin is paid his wages and leaves, but he will notice the characters and reveal the fact that he's a harper to them. Jamna Gleamsilver and Azabara Jos are in attendance, along with the rest of the cult folks. Instead of dispersing into the Trades ward, they head to a stable in the North ward, and the wagons are taken to a large warehouse just inside the North gate.

PCs might ask to inspect wagons or talk to the members of the convoy. See [https://5e-spelljammer.github.io/adventure.html#HotDQ,4,elturel](https://5e-spelljammer.github.io/adventure.html#HotDQ,4,elturel) for NPCs who are part of the caravan and what they're carrying.

Once the PCs identify Leosin (or he meets up with them later), they can learn from him:

- Overhearing some of the cultists talking, it's clear that the cult has been busy in the western heartlands, especially in the greenfields. Many small villages were attacked, and Greenest was only the largest.
- Two of the individuals traveling with the caravan were suspicious: a man with a large wool cap and an accent who is trying hard not to draw attention to himself, and a wily gnome that was paying too much attention to Leosin.
- Leosin strongly suspects the gnome is onto him, as he's seen her watching him when the caravan stops to rest. This scrutiny coupled with the hard schedule expected of a guard left virtually no time to contact Aya. He hopes she understands.
- The half-dragon is someone of great power and importance; she was clearly in command. Wherever she's headed, it's worthwhile to follow her. If Leosin leaves the city now, he might still be able to pick up her trail.

Leosin is determined to go after the half-dragon, knowing she is the key to whatever's happening with the treasure, but he urges the PCs not to lose sight of the treasure, as it'll likely lead them to the same goal. If [Sirge Wintermelt](../Characters/Sirge%20Wintermelt/%21index.md) is present, Leosin takes him along on Rezmir's trail. They set off immediately to find mounts; since the PCs can follow the treasure, Leosin doesn't want to waste a moment.

At the warehouse in the North Ward, the PCs can learn the following:

- The warehouse in question is one used for stockpiling building supplies that are sent north on the High Road to Neverwinter, used by Dagult Neverember's campaign to rebuild the city (the same ones the cult had been stealing on the Long Road).
- Peregrine's former cult handler, Varick, is supervising
- The Long Road Charter Company is...
