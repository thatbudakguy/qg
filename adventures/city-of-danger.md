## NPCs
- some sort of former colleague of calcey who needs the party to do a QPQ task for them (heist?) to get something


Calcey formerly prepared for a heist on the "national bank of Mulmaster" and posed as an inspector to get detailed intel on how to do the job. But, ultimately she abandoned this plan because it would've simply been too exposed/dangerous of a job.
