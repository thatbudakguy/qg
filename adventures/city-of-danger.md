## Timeline
```timeline
+ Hammer, 1510 DR
+ Thay joins the Moonsea League

+ Hammer, 1510 DR
+ Rebuilt Sahnd Krulek

+ Alturiak 22, 1510 DR
+ New leadership of Hangmen
+ Groshin Lor, spurred on by Xorack, uses his influence to divert many of the Hangmen from southroad and assume nominal leadership over them. With Xorack's knowledge of the sewers beneath the Imperial District, the Hangmen begin pulling off daring heists. A smaller lens, taken in the heist, is stashed in the old palace of revels.

+ Alturiak 24, 1510 DR
+ Devon Nanther leaves Phlan
+ [Aya Glemiir](../npcs/aya-glenmiir.md)'s student Devon Nanther of Melvaunt withdraws from her studies and returns home at the behest of his noble family.

MORE IDEAS:
- Aya or another beloved NPC is killed in a confrontation with Moonsea League soldiers or mages
- Brotherhood of the Cloak mages are reported to be snooping around somewhere (Steel Ave. house?)
- Ector Brahms cuts a deal to send all of Stojanow Gate's prisoners off to Mulmaster (to be used as "fuel")
- The out-of-work dockworkers and sailors of Phlan riot
- Red Wizards are sighted in the cities of the Moonsea, including Phlan, moving slaves around
- Calcey's old friend and mentor from her youth, Cere, is in Mulmaster
- We need to see and play up Calcey's connections and learn about her youth here, and how it was idyllic, to have impact for Witchthorn to take it away
- Intel from the Harpers, Gauntlet, etc. that points them in a particular direction?
- Intel from the Arcane Brotherhood re: usage of soulgems or connection to Thay
## NPCs
- some sort of former colleague of calcey who needs the party to do a QPQ task for them (heist?) to get something: Leon the Finger
	- Calcey formerly prepared for a heist on the "national bank of Mulmaster" and posed as an inspector to get detailed intel on how to do the job. But, ultimately she abandoned this plan because it would've simply been too exposed/dangerous of a job.
	- Leon wants a new lens for his workbench; his eyes aren't what they used to be. The lenses are large and quite expensive; they are of Gnomish make and imported from abroad. the Hangmen stole one off a ship and have one. In return, he will reveal the location of the _Heart of Thay_, a super-rare red diamond set in what was Dmitra Flass's engagement ring, which Calcey famously stole and lost in the same day (it's held by Xorack...sorry, Calcey!)
- Salvar Brix from Drowned tower: disgruntled Cloak member who has a writ/sigil granting access to Traveller's Cloak inn and gets them into the tower. What does he want in return? investigation into the murder of a friend?
- High Blade Jaseen Drakehorn
- Rending Talon Groshin Lor (Hawks of Mulmaster, Beholder patron Warlock, _disguise self_)
- Audra Maskyr, Sergeant of the City Watch
- The Hangmen, a Zhent-affiliated gang
	- Calcey knows their catchphrase: "every blade a black blade" -> "all blades are red when their work is done"
- Xorack, a Beholder living in the undercity
- Selfaril Coldshore (in the _sword of selfaril_)
	- He wants to challenge Jaseen Drakehorn one-on-one to a duel in the dueling circle outside Southroad Keep, as is traditional, to reclaim his place
## Locations
### Overall vibe
- Magic is regulated here. Everyone will be reminding you that you need to join the Cloaks if you stay longer than three months. If you use a lv3 or under spell in the presence of an official you'll be warned. If you use a lv4 spell or above you'll be hauled in front of a magistrate to face jail time or a fine, or forced to join the Cloaks.
- The sewers connect practically everywhere, but are quite dangerous. You can catch Sewer Plague! Also shit literally rolls downhill, so the closer to the docks you get, the worse it is. And flash floods happen randomly.
	- encounters: lacedons, kuo-toa, troglodytes
> When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.  It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest. At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character's exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.

### Docks Quarter
### Shipyards
- mulman flagship? see below. named after Dmitra Flass? "Lady Dmitra"

### Rusty Chock
the shitty bar option.

> The odor of salt, rancid meat, and stale grog hangs in the main room of the Rusty Chock. A bar sits along the left side of the room while half a dozen tables are scattered around the rest of the tavern. Questionable liquids pool on the floor, some dry and some still fresh. Rotted ropes and rusted hooked poles adorn the walls. Above the door to the back room is a piece of wood painted with two blue-green waves, one curling left and one curling right. 

proprietor Benkin Rould, human sailor 60yrs old. Worshipper of Umberlee.

Calcey's hideout could be in the sewer grate behind here.

### Mulmaster
THe Weapon is a deadlamp a la Locklands
- elfgates are permanent because they are permanent alterations in the weave that convince it that two places or opening are really the same place
- mythals are the same type of magic, but holding together all they complicated commands in once place and making them permanent required the sacrifice of living souls so that those people could control the parameters of the magic and keep it alive
- to Gensor/Thurndan, the elves were geniuses for inventing the gatekeeper's crystal, which is like a giant editing tool for mythals, gates, etc. because it allows you to tinker with them, e.g. you can "re-key" a mythal
- gensor became aware of the crystal when it was used to destroy Hellgate Keep in 1369. that place had a corrupted Mythal from the old elven city of Myth Glaurach, the city of Scrolls. he later went there and found a shard, stole some tomes, and went to the Tower of Arcane Might in Luskan to study.
- the use of the crystal as a weapon outright during the crown wars only happened once they discovered that you could annihilate a mythal by e.g. convincing it that the entire area it is supposed to protect is actually the size of a peanut. it was never intended to create or destroy!
- gensor has finally worked out (as of 1509) a crude way to generalize the crystal's power: convince reality that a mythal exists, temporarily, in a space so that the crystal can edit it.
- of course, gensor can't (even himself) cast high magic spells. and it would be impractical for him to always need to be with the weapon when it is used. so, instead, the weapon is powered via *soultheft*: condemned criminals are sacrificed and their life-energy briefly creates an imperfect *mythal*, which the crystal then "edits" out of reality.
- this effect is much like the deadlamps: a horrible feeling that reality is just a thin sheet of paper, it blinks out of existence in a perfect sphere leaving strange cross-sections of everything, then a massive sonic boom as the air rushes in to fill the space created by the emptiness.
- the actual weapon itself is an apparatus involving chained, hooded captives and a "focusing" rig or "lens" with the crystal inside it, operated by a crew of several mages of the Brotherhood. it is currently mounted on board a ship, having been used recently in Thentia.

We also learn that Thurndan was initially the one who sold the explosive magical devices to the cult in Waterdeep, which Peregrine used to blow up the temple. That was an early prototype that worked on the same principles as the crystal, before this weapon was created. The weapon using the crystal itself is "much cleaner!"
#### Tower of Arcane Might
_everything is fuckin trapped_
- This massive stone tower complex houses the group of mages once known as the Brotherhood of the Cloaks. That archaic usage has fallen out of favor for their moniker, “The Cloaks.”
- It has libraries, dormitories, laboratories, and vast storehouses of gold and magical items. The Tower is protected by golems, numerous defensive spells, and of course the magic and defenders of the Cloaks themselves.
### Tower of the Wyvern
- The fine marble structure is decorated with ornate stained glass windows, the largest of which is found set into the tallest tower and features a wyvern.
- Nearly four hundred guards and soldiers and forty Cloaks serve here at the High Blade's pleasure, along with a couple hundred servants.
- For over a century the castle also hosted a subterranean complex of luxurious baths, exhibition stages, and leisure chambers known as the Palace of Revels. All manner of debauchery and depravity were rumored to occur in its candlelit halls
### Tower of the Blades
- This opulent and expansive castle is home to the sixteen Blades who govern the city, with their families, servants, and bodyguards.
- A contingent of 300 soldiers and 30 cloaks also guard and staff the castle.
- The complex's entrances are always guarded with a six-man force, and each noble's wing of the complex is protected by various warding spells cast by Cloaks.
- This structure is also riddled with secret passageways and places to spy. There are several secret underground passages, some of which connect to one another, while other dungeon areas are isolated and can only be reached by passing through the rooms above.
### Southroad Keep
- Southroad Keep, Mulmaster's oldest building, is the heart of its bureaucracy, serving as the headquarters for the City Watch and tax collectors, as well as the site for Mulmaster's courts and prison.
- The squat, circular brick building serves as the constabulary headquarters, information center, tax-collection center, visitor's registration, courthouse, and prison.
- The building is nearly always crowded, and lines are long and slow. The inner chambers are constantly choked with throngs of people waiting to conduct business with the city, and the overworked officials are never in a great hurry to keep the lines moving.
- The prison lies underground and has approximately the same area as the aboveground portion. The gatehouse can seal off the city's south gate in the event of a siege. One hundred soldiers are posted here at all times, though the keep can house as many as six hundred when necessary.
