## NPCs
- some sort of former colleague of calcey who needs the party to do a QPQ task for them (heist?) to get something


Calcey formerly prepared for a heist on the "national bank of Mulmaster" and posed as an inspector to get detailed intel on how to do the job. But, ultimately she abandoned this plan because it would've simply been too exposed/dangerous of a job.

### Elmwood

### Mulmaster
THe Weapon is a deadlamp a la Locklands
- elfgates are permanent because they are permanent alterations in the weave that convince it that two places or opening are really the same place
- mythals are the same type of magic, but holding together all they complicated commands in once place and making them permanent required the sacrifice of living souls so that those people could control the parameters of the magic and keep it alive
- to Gensor/Thurndan, the elves were geniuses for inventing the gatekeeper's crystal, which is like a giant editing tool for mythals, gates, etc. because it allows you to tinker with them, e.g. you can "re-key" a mythal
- the use of the crystal as a weapon outright during the crown wars only happened once they discovered that you could annihilate a mythal by e.g. convincing it that the entire area it is supposed to protect is actually the size of a peanut. it was never intended to create or destroy!
- gensor takes this a step further: if you can get such an effect by marrying high magic to rapid edits in reality, why not streamline the process and do them both at once?
- the weapon sacrifices living souls in order to use a crude form of high magic at a distance, and then immediately uses the crystal to "invert" the magic that gets cast, editing the entire area of effect out of reality.

We also learn that Thurndan was initially the one who sold the explosive magical devices to the cult in Waterdeep, which Peregrine used to blow up the temple. That was an early prototype that worked on the same principles as the crystal, before this weapon was created. The weapon using the crystal itself is "much cleaner!"
