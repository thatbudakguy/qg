MORE IDEAS:
- Aya or another beloved NPC is killed in a confrontation with Moonsea League soldiers or mages
- Brotherhood of the Cloak mages are reported to be snooping around somewhere (Steel Ave. house?)
- Ector Brahms cuts a deal to send all of Stojanow Gate's prisoners off to Mulmaster (to be used as "fuel")
- The out-of-work dockworkers and sailors of Phlan riot
- Red Wizards are sighted in the cities of the Moonsea, including Phlan
- Calcey's old friend and mentor from her youth, Cere, is in Mulmaster

## NPCs
- some sort of former colleague of calcey who needs the party to do a QPQ task for them (heist?) to get something
- Calcey formerly prepared for a heist on the "national bank of Mulmaster" and posed as an inspector to get detailed intel on how to do the job. But, ultimately she abandoned this plan because it would've simply been too exposed/dangerous of a job.

### Mulmaster
THe Weapon is a deadlamp a la Locklands
- elfgates are permanent because they are permanent alterations in the weave that convince it that two places or opening are really the same place
- mythals are the same type of magic, but holding together all they complicated commands in once place and making them permanent required the sacrifice of living souls so that those people could control the parameters of the magic and keep it alive
- to Gensor/Thurndan, the elves were geniuses for inventing the gatekeeper's crystal, which is like a giant editing tool for mythals, gates, etc. because it allows you to tinker with them, e.g. you can "re-key" a mythal
- gensor became aware of the crystal when it was used to destroy Hellgate Keep in 1369. that place had a corrupted Mythal from the old elven city of Myth Glaurach, the city of Scrolls. he later went there and found a shard, stole some tomes, and went to the Tower of Arcane Might in Luskan to study.
- the use of the crystal as a weapon outright during the crown wars only happened once they discovered that you could annihilate a mythal by e.g. convincing it that the entire area it is supposed to protect is actually the size of a peanut. it was never intended to create or destroy!
- gensor has finally worked out (as of 1509) a crude way to generalize the crystal's power: convince reality that a mythal exists, temporarily, in a space so that the crystal can edit it.
- of course, gensor can't (even himself) cast high magic spells. and it would be impractical for him to always need to be with the weapon when it is used. so, instead, the weapon is powered via *soultheft*: condemned criminals are sacrificed and their life-energy briefly creates an imperfect *mythal*, which the crystal then "edits" out of reality.
- this effect is much like the deadlamps: a horrible feeling that reality is just a thin sheet of paper, it blinks out of existence in a perfect sphere leaving strange cross-sections of everything, then a massive sonic boom as the air rushes in to fill the space created by the emptiness.
- the actual weapon itself is an apparatus involving chained, hooded captives and a "focusing" rig or "lens" with the crystal inside it, operated by a crew of several mages of the Brotherhood. it is currently mounted on board a ship, having been used recently in Thentia.

We also learn that Thurndan was initially the one who sold the explosive magical devices to the cult in Waterdeep, which Peregrine used to blow up the temple. That was an early prototype that worked on the same principles as the crystal, before this weapon was created. The weapon using the crystal itself is "much cleaner!"
