The gang returns to Valhingen graveyard, either to further investigate the catacombs or meet with Yovir (perhaps to retrieve the catacombs map). If the PCs intend to go straight into the catacombs, they'll need a guide, since even the entrance is tricky to find. They should end up visiting Yovir's office before heading down.

Yovir is available, and can relate the following to the PCs.

- He's had several long meetings with the Lord Regent, some of which included leadership of the guilds. Simon has been managing the affairs of the Kelemvorites while he's been away.
- Yovir doesn't like to be pulled away from Valhingen and loathes being involved in politics, but the Kelemvorites provide important social services for the city, and he thinks that providing valued counsel might lead to better funding for the restoration of the graveyard.
- The Lord Sage seems especially agitated about the recent thefts in Scholar's Square. He has been making the case to the Lord Regent that the Cult of the Dragon has a larger presence in Phlan than previously thought, and that the city may be in grave danger if the Black Fist does not refocus its attention.
- The Guild Leadership, particularly the Innkeeper's Guild and Weaver's Guild, are demanding that the Black Fist first address the problem of the Welcomers before turning their attention to any cult activities.
- He had a copy made of the map the PCs found in the catacombs, and is happy to return the original to them.

While the PCs are speaking with Yovir, Simon enters in a state of great agitation. "Brother Glandon, pardon me but there's been - oh! It's the Magazine Gang!" Simon stands up on a chair in order to whisper a message into Yovir's ear. After a moment, Yovir gently stops him and suggests he tell everyone.

Simon tells the room that one of the senior acolytes of Kelemvor, Brother Keefe, has come forward with information suggesting that one of the longstanding residents of Valhingen, Xandria Welltran, was not human but instead a polymorphed green dragon.

Yovir's reaction is characteristically muted. He appeals to the PCs to ask what they would do in this situation: let the secret die with its owner, or exhume the crypt and find the truth? He is inclined to leave the situation alone, but the PCs wish to investigate further, he won't stop them. He asks Simon to determine where Brother Keefe is today and lead the PCs out to him.
