# The Cult Strikes Back, Pt. 1
## Overview
- The lord sage has been acting erratically upon learning that Gensor has returned to power in Mulmaster. He fears for his life and flees to Castle Atuke, a run-down ruin outside the city on Torath's March. He intends to hide there 
- Prior to Spernik's execution, he gave the information to the former Tears of Virulence in Stojanow Gate that the Quarantine Gang know where a Relic of Tiamat is, and this info made it to the Cult. Spernik was temporarily hired as a scribe and was able to guess that the Lord Sage might hide the Scale in his chambers.
- The Cult of the Dragon is preparing to take the Lord Sage hostage to extract information about the Scale of Tiamat or to extort the QG, but their efforts have triggered his paranoia, since he thinks they are Brotherhood agents.
## Encounters
- Prison break: Fulta, Tears of Virulence, Walharrow, Aleyd, various prisoners/black fists. This is intended as a diversion while the Cult moves on the Lord Sage or his office
- Castle Atuke: Allips (remnants of insane people), a Bodak in a tower (leader of the castle), and spectral Hippogriffs (the remnants of the Cavalry).
- Cult Strikes Back: the actual attack that attempts to kidnap the Lord Sage or break into his office, whichever it is. 

IF THE GANG CHOOSE TO DO THE COUNCIL OF WATERDEEP, ELLISON STEALS THE SCALE OF TIAMAT FROM THE LORD SAGE'S OFFICE AND REPLACES IT WITH A NOTE TO THE GANG THAT SAYS THE MONEY WAS TOO GOOD

## Revelations
- [ ] The Lord Sage of Phlan is Ranthor, half-brother to Denlor and Gensor.
	- [x] He asked Cassra to do research into Gensor/Thurndan and the Brotherhood of the Cloak before disappearing
- [ ] Thurndan Tallwand is Gensor, half-brother to Ranthor and brother to Denlor.
	- [x] Cassra knows that the Lord Sage requested information on Thurndan
	- [ ] The Lord Sage can reveal what he heard about Thurndan coming to power in Mulmaster and based on his research he found out that it's Gensor again. He has a portrait that he drew himself of the two brothers
- [ ] The Cult of the Dragon is preparing to take the Lord Sage hostage.
	- [ ] Aleyd knows that there was a big fight in the Stojanow Gate prison shortly after Spernik was executed. One of the inmates, a Zhent-linked highwayman named Markus Swiller, was stabbed by several of the former Tears of Virulence, though no weapon was recovered and nobody took responsibility for the crime. Aleyd suspects the Tears because they told different stories about what happened when questioned.
	- [ ] Any of the Tears or Fulta can be flipped in exchange for shortening their sentence or perhaps money to reveal that Markus knew too much: he caught wind of the fact that the Tears were communicating with someone on the outside about some information they got from Spernik right before his execution, though they don't know what.
	- [ ] The PCs can actually *speak with dead* the corpse of Spernik if it can be recovered; after the hanging it was publicly exhibited and then dumped outside the city gates. Aleyd would know where it is, but it's pretty decomposed.
	- [ ] The Tears arranged for a coded letter to be sent out indicating that they believe the Lord Sage is a target who would know the location of the Scale. the response to this message, intended to be delivered to Fulta and also written in code, is waiting at the mail depot in the Black Fist garrison outside the East gate (where Peregrine formerly picked up mail). It can be deciphered to indicate that the Lord Sage is in imminent danger and that a prison break is planned.
- [ ] Thurndan is currently active in Mulmaster and plotting to take over the Moonsea.
	- [x] Crew of the Seagull's Caw haven't been able to get anywhere east of Melvaunt due to blockades. Thentia was closed off, and they heard the Mulmasterite navy is everywhere in the East.
	- [x] Aya's last student, the noble Devon Nanther of Melvaunt, has withdrawn from her studies (when?), apparently at the behest of his family. Aya thinks the Nanthers are preparing for war.
	- [x] In Kabel's Hill, word is that Lord Maalthir of Hillsfar will soon cease sending Dragon's Breath liquor to the city, which the Brightbells pick up and sell at the Leaky Bucket, over Lord Regent Ector Brahms's refusal to join the "Moonsea League", a new confederation of city-states that is being run out of Mulmaster.
	- [x] On the docks, there are whispers that a great evil was recently perpetrated in Thentia. An arcane weapon of terrifying power was unleashed that destroyed the Watchlord's Tower. The next day, Thentia joined the Moonsea League.

## Nodes
### Denlor's Tower
#### Puzzle
- Derived from Chaos Magic Sigils, where words are encoded into a circle by converting them into numbers
- <s>Encoded names of Efreet only care about consonants, not vowels (borrowing from Abjads like Arabic), but encoded names in Common or other languages do (because they use an alphabet). Maybe the sigils can be different colors to indicate this.
- Sigils for Efreet names have small "diacritics" or indicators added onto the stop points to indicate the vowel, instead of actually "visiting" the vowel.
- See the Witch's Wheel method and [narZart method](https://www.chaostarot.com/app/kameas/narZart_original.jpg) for encoding techniques.</s>
Do them all as NarZart sigils, straight up. Too hard otherwise. Make sure that doubled letters (X2) and vowel (aeiou) are both enabled.
#### Journal
- Clue to the Lord Sage's identity
- Inside Denlor's room is information that is also a clue to City of Danger (hinting at Thurndan's identity)
### Stojanow Gate Prison
- Who is here? Walharrow, Fulta, some Black Fists who surrendered.
- Aleyd got put in charge of this place.
### Kabel's Hill

### Seagull's Caw

#### Seamen
- Arvin and Harumbr Copperpot, the two dwarves, are native Phlanites of the Copperpot clan, who once mined the Dragonspines but whose numbers have dwindled over the centuries. Quarrel with each other and everyone else.
