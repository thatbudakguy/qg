## The Well

- Mythal Properties: Those who are not faithful to Tiamat are affected by _sickening radiance_ (exhaustion, 4d10 necrotic, can't be invisible) DC 15 con save every round, can't stay saved
- Inside is Severin and The Hand Behind The Mirror and 100 captives, who have already been sacrificed to raise Tiamat.


## Nagamat

was raised by bathing his corpse, retrieved from far continent, in the waters of the well
he is insane, and believes/behaves as though the dragonfall war is still on
he can raise undead while he is still in the field?

- can't be killed unless phylactery is destroyed (Bahamut shows Peregrine this?)
- while he is alive, the tide of the battle goes against the alliance (in hex flower)
- once he is killed, the tide goes in their favor

phylactery: small lockbox bound with chains; inside are cultist souls
