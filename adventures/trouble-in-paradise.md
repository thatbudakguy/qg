# Trouble in Paradise
## Revelations
- Sandesyl turned the Vale Guard soldier Tyrael Mooncairn into a Vampire Spawn the night of Ches 10.
	- Trueshot or Rhaellen Darthammel know that Tyrael didn't return from his patrol on the night of Ches 10.
	- Captain Darthammel knows that Tyrael was a veteran of the Tomb Guard, not some fresh soldier. He was an expert ranger and, as a Cavewalker, knew the Passage better than most, as he was responsible for teaching it to the Elves who were preparing to leave the city.
	- Both men know that no patrols entered Skyreach on the night of Ches 10, as it wasn't deemed safe. Tyrael's route would have taken him around the perimeter of the castle.
	- It's difficult as the tracks are muddy and well-worn, but a PC can potentially retrace Tyrael's steps. A DC 20 Survival check reveals a scuffle took place some days ago on the far side of the castle, where a medium Creature struggled for some time. Blood was lost here, but oddly, only one pair of footprints leaves this area in a different direction.
- Sandesyl has established a new lair inside the Groaning Cave.
	- 
- The Mythal Stone that governs Evereska's Mythal is inside the Groaning Cave.
	- If not blindfolded, Declan's spellsight reveals that there are long magical threads running through the Passage itself, and winding out into the open space above the City. Something with a powerful connection to the weave must be hidden somewhere in the caves.
	- Mithriel has a small room at the Unicorn and Crescent that she uses as steward. In the room is a journal that reveals that about two years ago, Araevin brought Mithriel with him to a place called the Groaning Cave in order to test her in Elven High Magic (after years of practice with him). The trip seems to have been a mixed success.
- Sandesyl used her pawn Tyrael to abduct Mithriel Summergale the night of Ches 11.
	- Mithriel doesn't wake the party up on the morning of Ches 12.
	- Students at the Unicorn and Crescent can describe seeing Tyrael enter the place late at night, looking for Mithriel. He left after a short conversation with her. Nothing seemed amiss.
	- Mithriel's parents, who live near Moondark hill, haven't seen her in two tendays, as she's been busy with her stewardship and studies. She normally visits every few tendays.
	- An investigation check reveals that Mithriel's room at the Unicorn and Crescent hasn't been touched since the night of Ches 12.
- Another dragon mask is held by someone who is terrorizing the Misty Forest (link to Neronvain adventure).
	- Erlan Duirsar sends for the party using Manynests and invites them to an audience where he reveals that his contact with King Melandrach did not go well.
	- Or, later on, once the council contacts Evereska or the party, Duirsar will volunteer this information.

## Timeline
```timeline
+ Ches 9, 1510
+ Fast of the Hunt begins
+ Worshippers of Rillifane Rallathil begin their vernal equinox fast, and will continue for a tenday.

+ Ches 10<br/>day
+ Skreach Castle crashes
+ [Skyreach Castle](../locations/evereska/skyreach-castle-wreck.md) crashes into the Vine Vale of Evereska, oblitering several orchards and fields. 200 warriors of the Vale Guard are dispatched into the Vale with an escort of 30 Lordly Wands (Mage stats) to investigate the remains of Skyreach, and the Feather Cavalry are activated to patrol the Vale and report back on any potential survivors in the Greycloak hills. The Quarantine Gang are recovered from Eastpeak by Cpt. Rhaellen Darthammel and brought before the Hill Elders of Evereska to explain the fall of Skyreach. Hagar Bloodrop entrusts the _Black Dragon Mask_ to the Elders.

+ Ches 10<br/>night
+ A new lair
+ [Sandesyl Morgia](../npcs/sandesyl-morgia.md), having transformed into bat form and survived the fall of the castle, feeds on an unsuspecting soldier of the Vale Guard named Tyrael Mooncairn and transforms him into a Vampire Spawn. Using this new pawn, she moves some of the grave dirt from her lair on Skyreach into the Groaning Cave underneath Evereska, and there discovers a strange door sealed with ancient High Magic.

+ Ches 11<br/>day
+ Investigating the Skyreach wreck
+ A temporary camp is established around the wreck of Skyreach, and the Vale Guard call artisans and mages down from the city to aid in the disassembly of the castle. Accompanied by Tomb Master [Kinyon Colbathin](../npcs/kinyon-colbathin.md), the Gang enter the wreck of Skyreach and make their way to the top deck, which has been left intact. The party defeats the Vampire Spawn set by [Sandesyl](../npcs/sandesyl-morgia.md) to protect the remaining grave dirt in her lair, and make off with several magical items from the hoard of Glazhael.

+ Ches 11<br/>day
+ Evereska calls for aid
+ High Lord Erlan Duirsar contacts the elves of the Misty Forest to ask about the [Cult of the Dragon](../factions/cult-of-the-dragon.md), learning that raids have occurred there. In particular, Duirsar learns that a powerful sorcerer wielding a dragon mask has been attacking Elven villages on the back of a mature green dragon.

+ Ches 11<br/>day
+ Araevin's investigation
+ Archmage [Araevin Teshurr](../npcs/araevin-teshurr.md) analyzes the sword [Hazirawn](../npcs/hazirawn.md) and the _Black Dragon Mask_ and makes his report to the Quarantine gang about the nature and power of these items.

+ Ches 11<br/>night
+ Abduction of Mithriel
+ Sandesyl sends Tyrael, using _disguise self_ to appear as a normal soldier of the Cold Hand, into Evereska in search of one with knowledge of High Magic. The Spawn talks to several students at the [College](../locations/evereska/college-of-magic.md) and is eventually directed to the [Unicorn and Crescent Inn](../locations/evereska/unicorn-and-crescent-inn.md), where he finds Mithriel Summergale, student of Araevin. On learning that Mithriel has studied High Magic, Tyrael convinces her to accompany him to the Groaning Cave, where Sandesyl uses _dominate person_ to force Mithriel to open the door to the Mythal Chamber.

+ Ches 12<br/>night
+ Abduction of the sick
+ On learning that Mithriel lacks the power to corrupt Evereska's mythal on her own, Sandesyl resolves to make up the gap in High Mages required for a _Ritual of Complement_ by paying the cost in lives. She again sends Tyrael into the city, this time to visit the Floating Gardens, where the sick are tended to by the clerics of the Seldarine, including High Huntress [Thia Riverwall](../npcs/thia-riverwall.md). Tyrael abducts two elves, Laethan and Morian, who are suffering from [Marsh fever](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Marsh_fever).

+ Ches 13<br/>day
+ Cult forces assemble
+ After being contacted by Sandesyl, Severin Silrajin authorizes the assembly of an army to retake the Hoard of Tiamat and the Black Dragon Mask from the wreck of Skyreach. Preparing for the Mythal's defenses to be lowered, Severin orders the _Draakhorn_ to be sounded, and commands Varram the White to lead a detachment of dragons who assemble at the Well of Dragons to Evereska.

+ Ches 15<br/>night
+ Cult attacks
+ With a new moon leaving the power of the Mythal at its weakest, Sandesyl sacrifices the sick elves using _soultheft_ and forces Mithriel to use their power to alter the Mythal, removing its forbiddance against dragons. The Cult forces, including the dragons Vorgansharax (adult green), Lennithon (adult blue), and Glazhael (adult white), attack after nightfall, ravaging the forces in the Vine Vale and quickly taking control of the wreck of Skyreach.

+ Later?
+ Orders from Waterdeep
+ The newly formed Council contacts Evereska to demand that the treasure be held until it can be returned to the people, and requesting representation on the Council from the elves of Evermeet.
