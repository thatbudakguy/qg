# Metallic Dragons, Arise

# Adjustments

This is the adventure where Peregrine has the opportunity to become a Dragonborn of Bahamut.

Otaaryliakkarnos has informed Protanther that a suitable representative for the smallfolk has been found.

Protanther: we will act on our own, each for their own kind, but if the smallfolk will nominate one to fight alongside us, we will honor the old ways. This was the directive given us by Bahamut himself, when he ascended to heaven after the Dragonfall wars.

Each dragon may interrogate Peregrine in turn, who speaks for the party. The party has an opportunity to convince each of them.

### Protanther (male gold dragon)

attitude: cautious (needs 3 successes)

tenets:
- humans and elves are untrustworthy. all they desire is power. proof: see what the elves have done with the mythal magic we gave them. this was an error.
- elves have bent their powers to try to exterminate us in the past. counsel with the elves is impossible; they will use these events to justify eradicating us.
- peregrine is an impostor wearing the skin of bahamut-worshipper. he could have been great, which is what makes it worse.

desires:
- get a formal apology from an elven leader for the _dracorage mythal_ and misuse of mythal magic.
- find a leader worthy of speaking with the council.

### Ileuthra (male brass dragon)
- cult created many relics that are sins against dragonkind. the scale of tiamat is one of them, and i recognize it.
- recover the dragon masks and return them to the metallic dragons after the battle so that the cult cannot use them again

### Otaaryliakkarnos (female silver dragon)
- doesn't desire anything, supports the PCs because she knows that Peregrine apologized for what he did

### Nymmurh (male bronze dragon)
- doesn't think enough time has passed since destruction of temple of bahamut in waterdeep
- ancestors killed by the dragonmoots. get the dwarves to pay for what they did.

### Tazmikella (female copper dragon)
- lords and ladies of the sword coast and their paid adventurers looted her and her clan's hoards time and time again. wants a share of the treasure of the cult's hoard.
