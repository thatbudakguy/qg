# Area: Flagship _Lady Dmitra_
Massive warship with a unique design, moored in the Bay of Mulmaster
## Details
The ship has been designed so that its forward column, running through all three decks, is hollow and can accommodate a moving "elevator cage" containing the Scalpel and its "fuel". The "shaft" housing the cage is lead-lined in order to make it fireproof and resistant to certain type of magic. When the ship is at battle stations, the cage is raised up from the hold and locked in place in a special position atop the forecastle that gives it a nearly 360 degree line of sight atop the ship's main deck. When the Scalpel is not being used, it is lowered down the shaft into the Hold, where it serves as a Brig for detaining the "fuel" used to power the weapon.
