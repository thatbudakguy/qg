# House Rules

# Advantage and Disadvantage

When you roll with advantage or disadvantage, read the result of both dice out loud. You can say either the numbers on the die or the totals including any modifiers, followed by the end result, e.g. "a 5 and a 12, so that's a 14 to hit" or "a 25 and a 21, so 21".

This helps ensure that everyone is on the same page about when a character has advantage or disadvantage by clearly indicating when you are aware you have it (and when you aren't). It also heightens tension by revealing what *might* have happened had the advantage or disadvantage not been at play.

# Investigation vs Perception

[This article](http://dmsworkshop.com/2019/06/21/dnd-tips-perception-investigation/) sums up the difference well. The DM always chooses the check that is appropriate for the situation; players can specify what they intend to accomplish but not which check to use.

- Perception relies on a character's *natural senses*: seeing, hearing, smelling, etc. It represents focusing one particular sense on a task, like a dog sniffing the wind for a scent. Answering questions that begin with "Do I hear/see/smell....?" generally relies on Perception.
- Investigation relies on a character's *faculties*: logic, deduction, reasoning. It corresponds to focusing the mind on a particular problem, like Sherlock Holmes looking for clues. Answering questions that begin with "Why/how/when did...?" generally relies on investigation.

# Rounding

We round up, rather than down.

# Critical Hits

While the RAW are to roll double the *number* of damage dice on a critical hit, we instead double the *result* of the roll. The doubling applies to any die rolled during the attack action. The PHB (p.196) says:

> When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal...If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue's Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.
> 

For example, a level 5 rogue wielding a *flame tongue* greatsword in a sneak attack could potentially deal:

- 2d6 base slashing damage from the greatsword
- 5 additional damage, representing the rogue's proficiency bonus and strength modifier
- 2d6 additional fire damage from the greatsword when its flames are active
- 3d6 additional sneak attack damage

In this scenario, if a critical hit is scored, the only portion not doubled is the second item in the list (the strength modifier and proficiency bonus damage). The rogue can roll 7d6 together, double the result, and add 5 to determine the total damage.

# Spell Scrolls

## Scribing

- Characters can commission at most one scroll at a time from casters able and willing to perform this service.
- Scribing a spell scroll takes a number of days equal to the spell's level or the casting time of the spell, whichever is greater.

## Usage

These rules are taken from [a forum post](https://www.dndbeyond.com/forums/dungeons-dragons-discussion/rules-game-mechanics/9091-spell-scrolls-who-can-use-them?comment=9](https://www.dndbeyond.com/forums/dungeons-dragons-discussion/rules-game-mechanics/9091-spell-scrolls-who-can-use-them?comment=9).

- If the spell is on the character's class spell list, and it is a level they can cast, they can cast it with no problems.
- If the spell is on a character's class spell list, but is a higher level than they can cast, they can attempt to cast it by making an Arcana or Religion check (obviously corresponding to the type of spell it is) vs DC of 10 + the spell's level.
- If the spell is not on a character's class spell list, they can attempt to cast the spell by making an Arcana or Religion check vs DC 10 + the spell's level. If the check fails, the spell fails and they must make a scroll mishap check as per the variant rule in the DMG. (DC 10 Int save). On a failed save they roll on the mishap table in the DMG.
- If the character is not a spellcaster, they can attempt to cast the spell from the scroll with an Arcana or Religion check vs DC 10 + the spell's level *with disadvantage*. If the check fails, the spell fails and they must make a scroll mishap check as per the variant rule in the DMG. (DC 10 Int save). On a failed save they roll on the mishap table in the DMG.

# Travel

## On foot

According to the DMG (pages 242-243):

> The rules on travel pace in the Player’s Handbook assume that a group of travelers adopts a pace that, over time, is unaffected by the individual members’ walking speeds. The difference between walking speeds can be significant during combat, but during an overland journey, the difference vanishes as travelers pause to catch their breath, the faster ones wait for the slower ones, and one traveler’s quickness is matched by another traveler’s endurance.
> 

The PHB gives speeds for traveling on pages 181-182:

[Travel pace](%F0%9F%8F%A0%20Travel%20pace.csv)

Additionally:

- Traveling on difficult terrain halves the listed distance you can cover.
- You can cover the listed speed for up to 8 hours per day without engaging in a forced march.
- If you push on beyond the 8-hour limit, every character doing so must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour you continue traveling past 8. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour over 8 hours. On a failed save, the character suffers one level of exhaustion.

## On horseback

The PHB says:

> For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8-10 miles, characters can cover large distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.
> 

This ruling is sound, for two reasons:

1. Adventurers carry a lot of heavy equipment. Horses are swift runners, but carrying a human in addition to many pounds of metal and leather weighs them down considerably.
2. In real life, anyone making a long journey on horseback spends the vast majority of this time at a walking pace. The standard "four-beat walk" averages 4.0mph, the same as for a human.

Thus, using a mount confers no special speed advantage for multi-day trips. **Characters traveling on horseback use the same speeds as they would on foot**.

However, horses can be useful if one needs to travel a short distance very quickly, or wants to enjoy the benefits of engaging in combat while mounted. Additionally, horses can be used to carry gear that adventurers cannot move around on their own.

# Resurrection

We use Matt Mercer's "The Fading Spirit" rules for resurrecting dead players:

# Tool Proficiencies

We use the [rules from Xanathar's Guide](https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#tool%20proficiencies_xge) that give extra benefits to tool proficiencies, namely:

- If the use of a skill and a tool both apply to a check, and you are proficient with both, you have advantage on that check.
- For some checks, you have an added benefit as specified in the rules above.
