# Cult of the Dragon

The Cult of the Dragon has existed for centuries. During most of that time, its members have focused on the creation and worship of dracoliches, based on a prophecy translated by the cult’s founder, Sammaster. In recent times, however, the cult has undergone a schism, with some of its most powerful faithful throwing their weight behind a new plan: return the Dragon Queen Tiamat from her imprisonment in the Nine Hells to rule over Faerun.

The plots of the Cult of the Dragon are secret, but its existence is not. Most folk of the Sword Coast have heard of the cult, but know only that its members revere evil dragons. The cult recruits new members in major cities, and word quickly gets around. Moreover, many cultists engage in legitimate business or are assigned to ordinary academic research. Only a relative few serve as thieves, assassins, and spies.

Dragon-themed symbolism and iconography pervade the cult’s official regalia—black clothing that features a cape or cloak cut to resemble dragon wings, and festooned with jewelry and draconic imagery reflecting the wearer’s favorite type of dragon. Masks are common at cult gatherings.

The cult has a simple hierarchical structure, consisting of initiates on the bottom, a few ranks for cultists, and one highest rank for “Wearers of Purple”—the lords, leaders, and cult masters of particular locales. Those who follow Tiamat are ruled by a secretive inner group led by the Wyrmspeakers —a term of respect given to those whose bond with dragons is supernaturally strong.
