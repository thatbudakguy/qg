# Gatekeeper's Crystal
Legendary magical item (artifact)

Originally created by the Star Elf Morthil to imprison Magnar, The First Bear, this powerful artifact has been used as a weapon for millenia by armies across the universe. The crystal itself is composed of three shards, diamond-shaped fragments of an unknown oily-black metal about two feet long.

Each shard individually can manipulate _portals_ on the Material Plane, especially those created by the Elves, e.g. to alter their destination. When joined together, the crystal can completely annihilate a _mythal_, causing severe destruction over its entire effective radius and leaving a huge tear in the Weave.

## Moves

### Weavegate

When you attempt to use the Crystal to create, destroy, or alter a magical portal, roll Sd6 + CHA, where S is the number of shards you hold.

If creating a portal, the portal functions as the _Gate_ spell, with the following restrictions:

- The portal is the size and shape you intended.
- The portal goes to the location you intended.
- The portal will last for the duration of time you intended.

On a miss, none.
On a 7-9, choose two.
On a 10+, all three.

### Weavemend

When you attempt to use the Crystal to create or alter a mythal, roll Sd6, where S is the number of shards you hold.
Characters without knowledge of Elven High Magic make this roll with disadvantage.

### Weaverend

When you and two others each hold a shard of the Crystal, surround a mythal, and attempt to destroy it, each of you roll 1d6 and the results are added together.
Characters without knowledge of Elven High Magic make this roll with disadvantage.

On a hit, the mythal and everything contained within it are erased from existence. Air rushing into the resulting vacuum creates a sonic boom that deafens all creatures within 1d4 miles and a shockwave that deals 10d8 thunder damage and knocks Large or smaller creatures prone. A creature that succeeds on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw takes half damage and is not deafened or knocked prone.

On a 7-9, the erasure is messy. Flip a coin: on a heads, the location of the former mythal becomes a permanent _wild magic zone_. If tails, it is instead a _dead magic zone_. The blast radius and damage dealt due to the vacuum fillback effect is doubled.

On a miss, the Weave itself is irreparably damaged. All living things within 1d4 miles are annihilated, and magic ceases to function anywhere in the universe for 1d6 days. There is a cumulative 10% chance (1d10 + n) that the world ends.

Afterwards, the crystal's "failsafe" activates, scattering the three shards across the planes so that it must be reassembled to be used again in this way.
