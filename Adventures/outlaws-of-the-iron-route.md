# Background

- krulek was investigating the cadorna family's connection to the "lord of the wilderness"; a mysterious entity that animated evil forces in the area that is now new phlan around the time of Ren o' the Blade. He discovered the elder Porphyrys's connection to a secretive wizard and possibly learned that Porphyrys sought to kill Ren and his compatriots by sending them into danger, and then to help him seize the Pool of Radiance.

Jimmy buckets explains that there's been no yeast in the city for a month and the brewer's guild is striking. Many inns are down to their last few kegs of ale. His goddaughter Ellywick Dongolin has also come to stay with him, sent by his old adventuring partner Sinkur. Sinkur was always a wild one, but he settled down once he had a kid. Jimmy hasn't seen Ellywick since she was a toddler, and he stringently opposed Sinkur's plan to send Ellywick to stay with her godfather to help her "calm down a little". Ellywick is a sullen teenager who prefers to tinker and has no interest in helping Jimmy run the Crown. Jimmy slips on one of her sleds, used to move around the kegs, and blows up at her and sends her to her "room".

Braden Yil approaches the characters in the Cracked Crown on behalf of a coalition of noble merchant houses who are desperate to secure trade along the Iron Route. He brings with him a contract full of legalese that specifies a reward for the PCs investigating the outlaw gangs, including fine print about hazard pay, funds for mounts/ammo, etc (get creative). He offers to accompany the characters to grimshackle jail.

When they find the Paladin of Tyr who has been killed; the letter is signed by Ontharr Frume (of Elturel) instead.

When they kill a random young-ish human grey patriot, one of them screams "TIM!!!!"
