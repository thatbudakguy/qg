# Background

- Dagult Neverember, former Open Lord of Waterdeep and current Lord Protector of Neverwinter, has been pursuing a decades-long project to rebuild the northern city after its nearby volcano Mount Hotenow erupted in the mid 15th century.
- Dagult's efforts have mostly paid off - the city is close to its former glory. However, in recent months the shipments of building materials have been going missing from the High Road, which is normally a fairly safe and well-traveled route running north from Waterdeep.
- As executor of his father's properties in Waterdeep, Renaer was charged with investigating the disappearances. He found that the wagons frequently "went missing" around the towns of Red Larch and Westbridge, nearby Kryptgarden forest. Renaer's friends were able to confirm that the stolen shipments are being diverted into the forest at the hands of the Cult of the Dragon.

[interruption - eiruk announces ahash has arrived.]

- The Cult is not a new presence in Western Faerun, but it has never been a particularly successful one like it has in the East. That said, The Harpers have known that Cultists have sought for at least a century to gain the allegiance of the ancient green dragon Claugilyamatar (known as "old gnawbones"), who has laired in Kryptgarden forest for centuries. The dragon has thusfar rejected the cult's overtures to become a dracolich, instead relying on shapeshifting magic to prolong her life.
- Renaer's Moonstars are a capable group, but quite small, so he has been working with the aid of the Harpers. Harper agents that infiltrated the Cult have confirmed that it has returned to the forest, but there is a schism within the group. The old guard may still seek to convince Claugilyamatar to become a dracolich, or they may simply ask for her aid. A newer faction instead offers Claugilyamatar power in exchange for her assistance returning Tiamat to the material plane.
- Claugilyamatar is using the construction of a new fortress for her intermediaries the Zartruss hobgoblin clan as a way of gauging the power of the two cult groups. So far she's avoided becoming involved, but if the cult continues successfully siphoning shipments, they'll finish the fortress ahead of schedule, and Claugilyamatar is bound to take note of that. There are rumors that the cult is also negotiating with the dragon for some kind of artifact she owns.
- It's taken quite awhile to organize, but the major inter-city factions of the Sword Coast have all agreed to send agents to participate in this incursion. With enough boots on the ground, they'll stand a fighting chance against the Zartruss clan and may be able to strike before Claugilyamatar decides to intervene. Old Gnawbones is exceedingly cautious and slow to act, so their best hope is to be fast and seem scarier than they really are.

[interruption - madrak talking about stable charging rush prices]

- There are three objectives to the mission:
    - **Sabotage the fortress** (primary)**.** Claugilyamatar is using the construction of the new fortress for the Zartruss clan as a way to gauge which of the cult factions is worthy of her support. The two factions have avoided open conflict and instead are working on two different parts of the fortress in a race against each other. Erasing their work will show Claugilyamatar that the cult isn't worth her time.
    - **Investigate the Red Wizards** (secondary). The Order of the Gauntlet have also received reports of red-robed wizards traveling West through the heartlands to the Sword Coast north. If Thay is involved, this partnership could prove incredibly dangerous for Faerun. To learn more about this, the PCs will need to speak with the Order's delegation from Elturgard once they reach the staging area at Westbridge.
    - **Contact the dark fey** (secondary). The Emerald Enclave has learned that Claugilyamatar's corruptive influence is now widespread throughout Kryptgarden. Normally this influence would be checked by the power of King Witchthorn, a mysterious power whose court has long resided in the forest. The alliance wishes to know why Witchthorn has aided Claugilyamatar. To learn more about this, the PCs will need to speak with the Enclave's delegation once they reach the staging area at Westbridge.
- Renaer's plan is to depart Waterdeep tomorrow morning at dawn, bringing along with him the Moonstars, Harper delegation (the HAWKs), and Lord's Alliance delegation (Ahash). They will ride North together to Westbridge, and there meet the Emerald Enclave, Order of the Gauntlet, and Zhentarim delegations who are encamped awaiting their arrival.

[interruption from HAWKs here]

Any questions?

# Roarke House

## Arrival

> You feel your stomach drop out of your body as the symbols chalked on to the floor flare to life. The faces of Aya Glenmiir and the Lord Sage are whisked away, as though the interior of Denlor's Tower was painted onto a tablecloth that is crumpled up and ripped away from view. Then the vision plays in reverse, as a pinpoint of light blooms into a whirlpool of color and sound that violently snaps into place. Gasping from exertion, you find yourselves standing inside a circle of iron glyphs bolted to the wooden floor of a large, lavishly furnished room about 30 feet on a side. Warmth is radiating from a wood fire burning in a large fireplace, tended by a lithe human female whose leather armor is adorned with small disks of copper and brass that glitter in the firelight. She turns to face you with a grin. "Well, look what the cat dragged in. You just traveled 1500 miles in 5 seconds. How do you feel?"
> 

The first person the PCs meet upon arrival at Roarke House is Henna Castiglione (see HAWKs below), the halfling thief. She greets them with great interest:

- To Hagar: "well, now I see why they called you the Bear of Thar! Does that hair go all the way down?".
- Is totally enamored with Calcey and asks her to "I hope I look as good, at your age! remind me to buy you a drink later and steal all your secrets."
- To Declan: "that's a pretty little ball. Might want to hide it when Winona's around, her hands tend to wander."
- To Peregrine: "hmph, clerics. So boring. You look like you might even have been cute, once."

Henna explains that the Harpers are assembling forces here, at Roarke House, with the intention of setting out for Kryptgarden tomorrow morning. The property is a safe house and base of operations for a group organized by the noble Lord Neverember of Waterdeep, who is collaborating with the Harpers for this mission. She offers to brief the gang fully, or let them rest for a moment. Either way, Renaer appears and requests to brief the gang himself (use the background section above).

## Briefing

Renaer leads the gang into his study, a similarly well-appointed room with a massive cherrywood desk, many shelves overflowing with books, and noble portraits on the walls. As he briefs them, characters will briefly pop into the study to talk to Renaer:

- Eiruk Weskur, about Ahash Al-Mandi's retinue having arrived (see Combatants).
- The older halfling housemaster (Madrak), about purchasing provisions/horses (the stable is trying to charge Renaer rush pricing).
- Henna and Aisha, about Winona's missing favorite dagger (it's just at the bottom of her pack). Coy interaction with Renaer here; Henna calls him "honey" or some such despite being half his age; also refers to him as "Ren".
- The HAWKs also ask about going to the yawning portal and Renaer very relucantly allows it ("Would Remi want you doing this?" "Remi wouldn't care!"). Aisha asks the gang if they will come.

After the briefing, Ren releases them to do as they please, so long as they are present at Roarke house and ready to depart at sunup tomorrow. Everyone will ride together to Westbridge, slipping out the North gate at a time when an Armar friend of Ren's in the Watch will be manning it.

Ren cautions them against doing anything that would make them stand out – Waterdeep is a diverse city of adventurers, so they won't look out of place, but attracting the attention of the City Watch (or the Watchful Order) would definitely spell trouble, since they're technically here illegally and haven't registered – and the teleportation circle they saw is 100% illegal.

# The Yawning Portal

If Peregrine accompanies the group to the Yawning Portal, the HAWKs will here spring a trap on him.

## Bar Brawl

If Peregrine is present, this encounter could interrupt the interrogation.

> The noise of gamblers yelling and drunken adventurers singing bawdy songs is eclipsed by a sudden shout: "Like killin' me mates, does ya?" Then a seven-foot-tall half-orc is hit by a wild, swinging punch from a male human whose shaved head is covered by eye-shaped tattoos. Four other humans stand behind him, ready to jump into the fray. The half-orc cracks her knuckles, roars, and leaps at the tattooed figure-and your view is suddenly blocked by a crowd of spectators, knocking over furniture in their eagerness to watch the fight. What do you do?
> 

The five humans (Bandit statistics) are members of the Xanathar guild, led by one Krentz (tattooed guy). Their foe is Yagra Stonefist, a half-orc mercenary (Thug statistics) in the employ of the Zhentarim. Yagra easily wrestles Krentz down and knocks him out, but his "mates" will knock out Yagra if the PCs don't get involved. The HAWKs can provide info about both gangs, but won't get involved themselves.

## Troll Attack

As the fight is wrapping up, a Troll and nine Stirges emerge from the gaping well in the center of the taproom.

> Shouts of alarm ring out as a hulking creature climbs up out of the shaft in the middle of the taproom-a monster with warty green skin, a tangled nest of wiry black hair, a long, carrot-shaped nose, and bloodshot eyes. As it bares its yellow teeth and howls, you can see that a half-dozen bat-like creatures are attached to its body, with three more circling above it like flies. Everyone in the tavern reacts in fear except for the combatants, who haven't noticed, and the barkeep, who shouts "Troll!" and promptly reaches under the bar to retrieve a weapon.
> 

You can give the troll closer to full hit points to make this more exciting. The HAWKs will join in this fight using ranged attacks. Yagra also joins if she's conscious, but the Xanathar guild thugs run out.

Durnan looses two shots from his double heavy crossbow, then jumps over the bar with a greatsword to attack the troll himself. He orders anyone fighting to focus on the troll, and to douse it with lamp oil and set it aflame when it falls. He matter-of-factly compliments all who join in the fight.

# Westbridge

The gang leaves with the Harper/Moonstar and Lord's Alliance delegations, which is as large a group as Renaer can conceivably sneak out the gates with a little assistance from a friend with the Watch. The plan is to travel light, and meet the much larger force being assembled at Westbridge, where the delegations from the Order of the Gauntlet, Emerald Enclave, and Zhentarim are waiting. The journey to Westbridge takes one day, traveling at a fairly good clip.

When arriving in Westbridge, the gang finds that the rest of the folks mentioned above are already encamped outside the city.

# Kryptgarden Forest

# Adjustments

use the "leader track"; then shift to the faction champion table (battling Garbul). Switch the Zhent spy among the cult to a Harper spy?

maybe the best way to do this is actually to create a map, optionally allowing the PCs to explore all (or almost all) of the locations within Kryptgarden if they choose (but giving them initial orders from Renaer/the commanders). if they're moving quickly, you can space things out using random encounters in Kryptgarden. if things drag, someone can contact them on the sending stone letting them know time is running out until the meeting they're supposed to interrupt at the stronghold. so, both the fey track and thayan track could be options.

consider having the green dragon mask shown (or letting the PCs know that it will be available) at the end, but having some NPCs immediately leave to secure it when combat breaks out, making it difficult to recover. If the PCs do somehow recover it, this would be a huge coup, but it should be difficult.

could be cool to change the siege weapon to a ballista or similar, which could actually damage claugilyamatar: [https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Medium_Ballista_(5e_Equipment)](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Medium_Ballista_(5e_Equipment))

what happens afterwards? presumably all of the hobgoblins/cultists are defeated, claugilyamatar leaves, and the party returns to Waterdeep. potentially they could just have Eiruk create a temporary circle to return to Denlor's Tower right in Westbridge or one of the small towns they're using as a staging area.

## Combatants

A list of the various groups who have signed on to fight at Kryptgarden.

### Moonstars

The Moonstars, Renaer's group of old friends. They nominally serve the Blackstaff, but often act independently, sometimes in concert with the Harpers.

- [Renaer Neverember](../NPCs/Renaer%20Neverember.md)
- [Eiruk Weskur](../NPCs/Eiruk%20Weskur.md)
- [Laraelra Harsard](../NPCs/Laraelra%20Harsard.md)
- [Meloon Wardragon](../NPCs/Meloon%20Wardragon.md)

### Harpers

The HAWKs, a famous gang of Harper-aligned rogues based in Waterdeep. The HAWKs are all young women in their 20s who came up together on the streets of Waterdeep's Dock Ward. They know of the Foxteeth by reputation. Remallia Haventree ("Remi"), Wise Owl of the Harpers in Waterdeep and lady of house Ulbrinter, considers all of the HAWKs like daughters to her, as her adult children live outside the city and her husband was assassinated many years ago.

- [Henna Castiglione](../NPCs/Henna%20Castiglione.md)
- [Aisha Cantos](../NPCs/Aisha%20Cantos.md)
- [Winona O'Heron](../NPCs/Winona%20O'Heron.md)
- [Kirsten Solari](../NPCs/Kirsten%20Solari.md)

The HAWKs are being "looked after" at Kryptgarden by Renaer and [Leosin Erlanthar](../NPCs/Leosin%20Erlanthar.md), the Harper monk from Berdusk.

### Lord's Alliance

The Calishite retinue of Ahash al-Mandi, famed warlock of Calimport. Ahash has been hired by the house of Al-Qutaa to serve as the Lord's Alliance's contribution to the coalition forces at Kryptgarden. The Calishite nobles are hoping that this substantial offering does not go unnoticed by Waterdeep's nobility and gives them an upper hand in the lucrative wine trade.

- [Ahash al-Mandi](../NPCs/Ahash%20al-Mandi.md)
- 10 Male Human Mercenaries, N. Guard stats.
- 2 Female Human Servants, NG. Commoner stats.

### Emerald Enclave

- The Dusk Circle, a small group of druids from Kryptgarden, near the town of Kheldell. Led by Shala Thaeral, voice of the circle.
- Various wood elf archers and rangers from the High Forest.

### Order of the Gauntlet

- Paladins, Clerics, Fighters from Elturgard (Order of the Gauntlet/Order of the Companion).
- Led by Ontharr Frume, Vindicator and head of the Elturel chapter of the order.

### Zhentarim

The Doom Raiders were five unscrupulous adventurers who liked to plunder lich lairs (called "dooms" by some). They gave up adventuring to join the Black Network and came to Waterdeep three years ago with plans to establish a Zhentarim foothold in the city. In that time, they have forged alliances with various nobles and guilds and run afoul of others, all the while fending off
Harper spies.

- Various sellswords from across the sword coast
- the Doom Raiders, a former adventuring party who are working for the Zhentarim.
