# The Danger at Dusk

# Hook

[Fillistrom Wunderkundoodle](../Characters/Fillistrom%20Wunderkundoodle.md)'s daughter Villonah is captured by the Black Fists and imprisoned under the Lyceum.

If the party goes to the Lyceum, they find that it has been turned into an aid station by followers of Lathander, the Morninglord. 

Notes on Lathander (easy Religion check):

- God of creativity, dawn, revival, youth, athletics, vitality.
- Followers are known as the Awakened; clerics are known as Dawnbringers.
- The god has a long-running romantic affiliation with Chauntea.

Horus Brightwater, a LG Tethyrian Paladin of the Order of the Aster, is in charge at the Lyceum. He is bald, with dark skin - maybe late 40s, with a deep voice. Horus wears half-plate enameled in white and gold and adorned with a radiant sunburst, with a red cloak over the top to keep out the cold. He commands a small group of 5-10 Awakened who distribute rations and administer simple first aid. Once per day at sunrise, he casts *create food and water* to fill several large wooden barrels with clean water, which is provided to anyone who asks. Fresh bread is donated by the halfling bakers who live near the laughing goblin.

Horus arrived in Phlan with his contingent of followers in the late spring, having traveled from the temple of Lathander's Light at Dagger Falls on the Western edge of the Moonsea, near the Dalelands. Horus called Lathander "the Morninglord". He remarks on the early fall weather if engaged in conversation, and offers to give the PCs any aid that they require. If questioned about the riot, Horus reveals that his staff treated a large influx of people for minor injuries sustained during the mob, but no one with life-threatening wounds. If questioned about the Lyceum, Horus does not hide his disgust for Bane, and comments that Brahms was quick to dub the destruction of the Lyceum a "riot" as well, even though it clearly represented the will of the people.

Quotes:

- "This city is boiling over. I cannot stop it, but with His grace maybe I can save a few lives."
- "I abhor chaos, but the Lord Regent has gone too long without hearing the voices of his people."

# Adjustments

- when Yllivia meets the party, she can talk about being assigned to travel to Phlan to investigate the Black Fists by [Ontharr Frume](../Characters/Ontharr%20Frume.md) of Elturel. Describe her as wearing a climbing harness, gloves, and her boots have special tips. Her short white hair is pulled straight back. She enunciates her words quite strongly.
- A history check can reveal the following about the [Order of the Gauntlet](../Factions/Order%20of%20the%20Gauntlet.md):
    - Allies of the [Harpers](../Factions/Harpers.md)
    - Favored deities are Torm, Tyr, Hoar, Helm; often clerics/paladins
    - Focus on revealing and punishing acts of evil, faith is one's best weapon
- Yllivia has been in the city for about three months; she began the long trek to Phlan from Silverymoon once Brahms announced martial law. She's mostly been gathering information and sending messages to her counterparts in Mulmaster and Waterdeep.
- If the party asks how she got into the stronghold, she can talk about having observed the fists paying off the ferry captain. Deducing that they were underneath the Lyceum, she convinced Horus to distract anyone watching (not difficult when she explained her mission) and rappelled over the city wall and down the other side (quite difficult, but she is an experienced climber).
- Once Villonah comes to, she can shakily relate the following:
    - Her dad has no idea that she works for the [Order of the Gauntlet](../Factions/Order%20of%20the%20Gauntlet.md). It's easier for her to let him think that she's just a fuckup - and anyway, it's not untrue. She loves drinking and gambling, and she's happiest in a tavern.
    - She's had a difficult relationship with her father ever since it became clear that she didn't share his obsession with herbology.
    - She met Yllivia at the Laughing Goblin about a month ago. Yllivia sensed the young gnome had frequent run-ins with the Black Fists, and contrived to use her as a mole to investigate the situation inside Stojanow Gate.
    - Once, when she was thrown inside the gate for the night, Yllivia overheard her jailers discussing something about a White Dragon living in the Galena Mountains.
    - The "drunk tank" cell is not particularly secure, and the next time she was able to smuggle in a pick that let her escape for long enough to steal the map. She used Fillistrom's supplies to work a piece of fake skin out of leather.
- If inspected, the map shows a river running through the Galena mountains labeled "Snake", with a X marking a spot roughly halfway in between the two points of Bloodstone Pass and Justin's Mine.
- If the PCs tell Yllivia of the other cult plots they have foiled, she cops to knowing about the apprehension of Spernik (and is appreciative that he has been publicly exposed), but is dismayed to learn anything else. If they learn anything else that might expose collusion between the cult and the Fists, she asks them to report it to [Marten Foss](../Characters/Marten%20Foss.md) and tell them that she sent them.
