# Yovir Glandon

Doomguide Glandon is the highest-ranking member of the Clergy of Kelemvor in Phlan, known as the Order of the Silent Shroud. A tall, pale man who moves and speaks slowly, he radiates a seriousness that has allowed him to remain a respected neutral party in the often hot-tempered politics of the city.

Yovir was the first person most of the Gang spoke to after their arrival in Phlan, and he has engaged their services to keep Phlan safe from both [cult-of-the-dragon](../factions/cult-of-the-dragon.md) agents and the marauding undead that sometimes surface in Valhingen graveyard. The Doomguide treats the entire cemetery as a giant garden â€“ one that he has made it his personal mission to restore to a sparkling place of quiet contemplation.
