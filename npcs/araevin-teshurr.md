# Background

In 1374 DR, Araevin had just been accepted to study High Magic at Tower Reilloch on Evermeet, but was chafing at the 50-year wait time and longed for adventure. When the Daemonfey attacked Evermeet and stole a shard of the *[gatekeepers-crystal](../items/gatekeepers-crystal.md)*, Evermeet was thrown into chaos. In short order, Sarya Dlardrageth used the *Crystal* to open Nar Kerymhoarth, the Nameless Dungeon, and release the rest of her cursed kin. Araevin had his wish: Seiviril Miritar, the father of his betrothed, Ilsevele, began organizing a crusade to retake Myth Drannor from the Daemonfey. Seiviril resurrected the Elven hero Fflar “Starbrow” Melruth to lead his crusade.

Returning to Faerun via the Elfgates he knew so well, Araevin assembled a group of friends from his youth and formed the Company of the White Star, with the objective of recovering the other pieces of the crystal. Instead, they found a *selu’kiira*: a High Loregem from the ancient empire of Aryvandaar that contained the soul of a mage with the knowledge of Elven High Magic. While Araevin and his friends scoured the continent, Fflar, Ilsevele, and her father defended Evereska from the daemonfey, suffering heavy losses.

When the mage reunited with his betrothed, he did so as a different man. To become capable of wielding high magic as an individual, Araevin effectively gave up his individuality, completing a ritual called the *Telmiirkara Neshyrr* that made him half-celestial but granted him enormous power as well as “the sight”. This power allowed him to essentially “rewrite” Myth Drannor’s corrupted mythal, paving the way for Seiviril’s crusade to retake the City of Song. It also put the nail in the coffin of his dying relationship: Ilsevele broke off their engagement and, when her father fell in battle, became Coronal with Fflar at her side.

Rudderless, Araevin returned for a time to his childhood home, the House of Cedars. Reflecting on his life, the mage decided that as one of the few living practitioners of High Magic, he should pass on the knowledge however he was able. Finding Evermeet too full of painful memories he had shared with Ilsevele, he sought seclusion in Evereska, quickly rising to the position of High Mage. In the nearly 150 years since the daemonfey attacked, Araevin has taught generations of students.

# Key Info

- Mythals / High Magic
    - are permanent alterations to the weave at a massive scale, often to protect an entire city
    - often required the sacrifice of multiple lives in order to cast, especially after Mystra's Ban prohibited spells of level 10 and above.
    - knowledge was once passed from Elves to Humans and powered Netheril’s floating enclaves
    - can show the one in Evereska, which is weak but functional, if he knows Declan has spellsight (”don’t tell anyone, but i didn’t know if it would hold up under a direct hit...”)
    - evereska's mythal regulates the weather of the city and part of the vine vale (out to the meadow wall) and prevents disease & slows aging.
- The *[gatekeepers-crystal](../items/gatekeepers-crystal.md)*
    - enormously powerful artifact that felt, to him, like it was not of this world. yet it could easily have been a weapon of the crown wars era
    - total dominion over portals, prisons, and planes: open, close, knowledge, etc. all just an extension of one’s will (when assembled).
    - negating *mythals* in particular caused violent explosions and scattered the pieces of the crystal; maybe a safety device?
    - pieces tended to go to places where it had been used before, as though there was more “gravity” in the weave there. but neither he nor sarya ever found them all again after Nar Kerymhoarth was opened
- Myth Drannor
    - 23 years ago (recently, to Araevin!) Ilsevele contacted him warning him the city would fall and to stay away. He told no one of this and respected her wishes, praying she would be able to flee safely to Evermeet, where she now stays.
    - the city has fallen back to ruin now. he never once visited ilsevele during their more than a century apart, but he heard she made it beautiful, like in the old days.
    - Trueshot fought to defend the city and was one of the few who returned alive. He knows more about what happened.
