# Kirsten Solari

Faction: ../Factions%20edaaed8213e2408cb90615e4d1814587/[harpers](../articles/factions/harpers.md)%20f87016ea46da4fec858732a38796985b.md

Kirsten wields a longsword and knows how to frighten strangers with her appearance – or failing that, a little illusion magic. Sometimes given to bouts of fatalism, she has a kind heart, and has been searching for her lost brother Dunbar since the two were separated very young.

Kirsten is one of the HAWKs, a group of rogues from the [harpers](../articles/factions/harpers.md) who grew up together on the streets of Waterdeep's dock ward.
