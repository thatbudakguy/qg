# Kinyon “Trueshot” Colbathin

# Appearance

Unusually brawny elven man with blonde hair cut in a very short mohawk, wearing trimmed plate armor over a fine chain shirt.

# Roleplaying

- Speaks with arms crossed nearly all the time.

# Background

Tomb Master of Evereska, responsible for the Feather Cavalry and Tomb Guardians that range into the Vine Vale and beyond. Obsessed with protecting the LastHome and keeping it secret. Earned his fame and his rank through outstanding service (not by noble birth) in two wars: against the Daemonfey, and again against the Shade Princes in Myth Drannor. Respects others who did the same.

Councils [erlan-duirsar](erlan-duirsar.md) not to intervene in others’ foreign affairs, given how devastating the second fall of Myth Drannor was to his forces. Not in favor of squaring off against the [cult-of-the-dragon](../factions/cult-of-the-dragon.md) and unlikely to support sending aid to King Melandrach or elves elsewhere on Faerun. Believes when all other bastions fall, the LastHome will stand, as it did against the Daemonfey (and would have done, without any help). We fight on our home ground, or not at all!

# Key Info

- Evereska is protected by the hills of the Shaeradim and the Three Sisters cliffs, in addition to its armed forces. It has never and will never be taken by a conqueror.
- Myth Drannor fell because a human wizard couldn’t find any other way to win besides destroying it along with the returned Netherese enclave. Our own High Mage might have done differently, but he wasn’t there...
