# Aisha Cantos
Aisha is short of both stature and temper, and often wearing an intense expression. She does not shy away from staring contests with strangers and is deadly with a handaxe. She has an animal companion, a black cat named Cyne.

Aisha is one of the HAWKs, a group of rogues from the [Harpers](../articles/factions/harpers.md) who grew up together on the streets of Waterdeep's dock ward.
