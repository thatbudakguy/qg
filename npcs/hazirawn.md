# Hazirawn

## Appearance
> This ancient greatsword has a wicked-looking black blade with a set of spines about halfway down its length. It sports a crossguard that curls back towards the wielder, and its pommel is inset with a huge amethyst. It occasionally emits bursts of cruel laughter, along with curses in common and a strange-sounding foreign language.
## Roleplaying
- A low, evil laugh followed by unbridled scorn.
- Utterly nihilistic worldview coupled to an unshakeable sense of purpose: killing.
- Urges its wielder to use *detect thoughts* so that Hazirawn can also learn others' thoughts.
## Background
The Sword Hazirawn was forged during the height of the Netherese empire. Once a successful military commander for the Netherese empire, Lord-General Hazirawn led numerous skirmishes and rarely suffered a loss. Over a long military career spanning several centuries (thanks to the spells of the Council), he was responsible for many significant protective actions. He was summarily selected for “the process,” and upon reporting to the "Laboratory" (a Netherese black site) he was pressed into the greatsword; the process for which is detailed in the _Principae Antiquus_ spellbook. The “Findings” section indicated that Hazirawn felt he could be an eternal instrument of the Empire.
