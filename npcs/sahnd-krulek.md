# Sahnd Krulek
Once among the most promising Knights of the Black Fist, Sahnd fell from grace when his personal investigation into the history of the noble houses of Phlan turned up information that made him a target. Convicted of treason against the Lord Regent, he and his closest followers were exiled.

Outside the city, Krulek's righteous anger against the Cadorna family festered into a full-blown vendetta. By directing his followers to assault caravans headed to Phlan along the Iron Route, the exiled knight hoped to bring the city to its knees and force a confrontation, but instead he descended further and further into outright banditry.

The noble houses of Phlan offered the Quarantine Gang a lucrative reward for ending the threat of Krulek once and for all. Although they tracked him and his Grey Patriot gang to their hideout at King's Pyre, they kept him alive long enough to witness the death of his remaining friends and enemies at the hands of the Burning Banner orc tribe. In return for sparing his life, Krulek faced down an owlbear alone in order to buy the gang time to escape.

With the elimination of the majority of the bandits of the Grass Sea, the Gang happily collected on their rewards. However, they are now the only ones who know the truth: Sahnd Krulek still lives. Whether he will find a way to retake Phlan is another matter.

# DM Notes
- after the owlbear attack, [Thurndan Tallwand](../Thurndan%20Tallwand/%21index.md) arrived just in time to find his Chosen betrayed and his property stolen. But the Great Possessor was not about to lose his remaining pawn in the game, having turned Krulek onto the secret of the Cadornas in the hopes that his investigation would roil Phlan and make it ripe for the taking.
- taking what remained of Krulek, Tyranthraxus spirited him away to his hideout in the Tower of Arcane Might and began the lengthy, painful task of converting the soldier into his next "experiment". At first, Sahnd merely assumed he was being further tortured by some demented [cult-of-the-dragon](../articles/factions/cult-of-the-dragon.md) wizard, but as the two traded barbs, the former Black Fist came to discover an intelligence far more cunning and determined that his own...and one that shared the goal of retaking Phlan from the craven two-faced noble familes that held it. In fact, the wizard seemed to know an *incredible* amount about the history of Phlan...far too much for someone who claimed to be merely a Senior Cloak of Mulmaster.
- Using his considerable talents, Tyranthraxus forged a new body for Sahnd - one able to withstand substantially more punishment.
