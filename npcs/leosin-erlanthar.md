# Leosin Erlanthar

A tall, thin, half-elven monk who is soft-spoken but alert. Leosin hails from Berdusk, in the Western Heartlands, where he has served as a contact for the [harpers](../articles/factions/harpers.md) . The monk researches the [cult-of-the-dragon](../articles/factions/cult-of-the-dragon.md) , including its history and present objectives, and frequently travels between his home and Candlekeep.

He often communicates with fellow [harpers](../articles/factions/harpers.md) [aya-glenmiir](aya-glenmiir.md) of Phlan and Remallia "Remi" Haventree of Waterdeep, and serves as a liaison between the [harpers](../articles/factions/harpers.md) and the [order-of-the-gauntlet](../articles/factions/order-of-the-gauntlet.md) through his friendship with [ontharr-frume](ontharr-frume.md).

Leosin trained [sirge-wintermelt](sirge-wintermelt.md), who he sent on a mission northward to the Moonsea and who was eventually rescued by the Quarantine Gang at King's Pyre. During the battle of Kryptgarden forest, Leosin landed a stunning strike directly on the great dragon Claugilyamatar, buying the Gang just enough time to flee to safety.
