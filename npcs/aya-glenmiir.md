# Aya Glenmiir

Aya is an elderly half-elven woman with a graceful bearing who is fond of long, flowy clothing and speaks softly. She is accompanied by her familiar, a silver-colored monkey.

As the proprietor of a small magical academy in the Scholar's Square neighborhood of Phlan, she is good friends with the [lord-sage](lord-sage.md), whom she deeply respects as likely the oldest living resident of the city. Aya excels as a teacher of magic, but is only a moderately accomplished wizard. She has a strong interest in the Weave, the innate magic that permeates the known universe.
