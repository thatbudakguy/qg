# Cassyt Melrona

This young acolyte of Kelemvor has spent more time in her books than in the catacombs of Valhingen Graveyard. Despite this, she has an unfailingly sunny disposition and is prone to dispensing humor and trivia about the graveyard's "residents", a talent the Quarantine Gang experienced firsthand during their initial venture into the catacombs.

After the Quarantine Gang cleared out the [cult-of-the-dragon](../factions/cult-of-the-dragon.md) and [red-wizards-of-thay](../factions/red-wizards-of-thay.md) underneath the graveyard with Cassyt's help, she was formally inducted into the Order of the Silent Shroud by [yovir-glandon](yovir-glandon.md).
