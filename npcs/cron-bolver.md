# Cron Bolver

This hard-driving Knight of the Black Fist showed his age in a weathered, lined face often set in a frown or sneer. Formerly a Sergeant serving with [Aleyd Burral](Aleyd%20Burral/%21index.md), Cron was content to use [Phlan](../locations/phlan.md)'s period of martial law to line his own pockets until the main obstacles to his promotion were unceremoniously eliminated by the Quarantine Gang – his superiors.

With his sudden promotion to Lieutenant, Bolver appeared to have developed a taste for power as well as coin. From the satchel of a [cult-of-the-dragon](../factions/cult-of-the-dragon.md) operative recovered from the battle of Kryptgarden, the Gang learned that the Lieutenant had been leading a covert faction within the Black Fist who swore loyalty to the dragon Vorgansharax, in return for power once the Maimed Virulence staked his claim to the Cinnabar Throne.

By sending [Sirge Wintermelt](Sirge%20Wintermelt/%21index.md) undercover among the Black Fists, the Gang were able to collapse Bolver’s plans to mutiny and take Phlan for the Cult, leading to the Battle of Valhingen Graveyard in [End of the Line](../logbook/End%20of%20the%20Line.md). Though his Tears of Virulence fought fiercely, Cron was stopped cold by [aya-glenmiir](aya-glenmiir.md)’s psychic magic. In the end, it was Sirge himself who put a sword in the heart of the Lieutenant, closing the book on the latest threat to menace Phlan.
