# Renaer Neverember
Renaer – "Ren" to his friends – is tall and dashing, every inch a noble son. He wears large black riding boots and a fine silk tunic, with an elaborate rapier at his side. He laughs often but is exceedingly polite when required, a consequence of his noble upbringing.

Renaer is the heir of House Neverember, one of (if not *the*) richest noble families of [Waterdeep](../locations/waterdeep.md). His mother died when he was much younger, leaving him a substantial fortune. He spent his youth staying barely one step ahead of the City Watch with a close circle of friends, who never let rules get in the way of their adventuring.

The younger Lord Neverember detests his father, the former Open Lord of Waterdeep Dagult Neverember, and the two have a chilly relationship. Despite this, Renaer has managed his father's innumerable properties in Waterdeep for many years during the latter's long absence while serving as Lord Protector of Neverwinter.

Renaer is the de facto leader of the Moonstars, a small group of friends who serve the Blackstaff, Waterdeep's famous Archmage.
