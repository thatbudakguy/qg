# Aleyd Burral

A member of the Black Fists—and one of its few who are benevolent—Knight Lieutenant Aleyd Burral has become deeply troubled by the actions of her fellows. She is convinced of the righteousness of her Knight Commander and knows that he might be willing to take action given enough proof. But how will she get that proof?

So far, the Quarantine Gang has been the answer. Though Aleyd is wary of revealing herself to her compatriots, she has been willing to feed information to the Gang as they continue to investigate the role of the [Cult of the Dragon](../factions/cult-of-the-dragon.md) in [Phlan](../locations/phlan.md), and how deep their agents have penetrated into the city's veins.

Aleyd has led a violent life, and in recent years she has become disillusioned with her lack of progress in the Black Fists. Her former squadmate [Cron Bolver](cron-bolver.md) seems to have been rewarded for his avarice by a promotion, making things even more bleak. Her desperation shows in her interactions with the Gang, but she has given up the idea of success as a soldier.
