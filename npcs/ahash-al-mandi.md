# Ahash al-Mandi
al-Mandi (who is referred to by his family name, in the Calishite fashion) is tall for a Calishite, with a prominent mustache and a blustery arrogance. He refers to himself in the third person.

A famed warlock of Calimport, al-Mandi was contracted by the House of al-Qutaa to represent the [Lord's Alliance](../factions/lords-alliance.md)  at the battle of Kryptgarden. Though he survived the assault on the Zartruss fortress in [what's-up-with-that-catapult](../logbook/what's-up-with-that-catapult.md), the hired retinue who accompanied him north from Calimport were completely wiped out.
