# Alireza Hormuzd

[DM Notes](../campaign/pcs/declan-truefire/DM%20Notes.md)

This cranky genie was imprisoned by the wizard Denlor, and has served as a form of central heating in the wizard's tower for an unknown period of time. When [Peregrine Buntly](../Peregrine%20Buntly/%21index.md) investigated the painting of an Efreet on the door to Denlor's chambers, Ali finally revealed himself, accusing the gang of squatting in the great wizard's tower.

Ali's spirit has been bound into Denlor's tower, but he can move between windows and doors within the tower freely. He generally manifests as a stylized painting of himself on the door to Denlor's personal quarters, which he was explicitly commanded to guard against any not worthy of entering. In life, Ali looked like other Efreet: a large, well-muscled humanoid with dark red skin of about 12 feet tall, with small horns sprouting from his bald head.

# DM Notes

- attempted to control efreet
- was an evoker
- from halruaa
- bound the spirit of an efreet (Ali) to serve as the door guardian to his personal study, as well as the heating system for his tower in winter, since he was used to the warm and humid climate of halruaa. a sort of calcifer.
- For reference for Ali, see:

[Ali - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali)

- became a great friend? commander? of the efreet, such that he was made a gift of *mutaghayir*, the flame tongue short sword forged by them
- died prior to the spellplague and had no knowledge of halruaa's shift to abeir or its return.

puzzle to unlock access to Denlor's Chambers is to beat Ali at a game of chess. Ali, of course, can't be beaten â€“ but Denlor beat him by cheating.

puzzle to heat the tower is to answer a riddle (the one about being beaten half to death).

# History

When the wizard Denlor began extraplanar voyages to the City of Brass in the 1320s, he sought the legendary weapons forged by its denizens, the fire genies called Efreet. 

# Appearance

Ali's spirit has been bound into Denlor's tower, but he can move between windows and doors within the tower freely. He generally manifests as a stylized painting of himself on the door to Denlor's personal quarters, which he was explicitly commanded to guard against any not worthy of entering. In life, Ali looked like other Efreet: a large, well-muscled humanoid with dark red skin of about 12 feet tall, with small horns sprouting from his bald head.

# Talents

Like others of his kind, Ali was a talented weaponsmith, having forged the *flame tongue* short sword *mutaghayir* which Denlor carried as a personal blade.

# Interactions

Ali is haughty and imperious, frequently reminding those who now inhabit Denlor's tower that they are worthless trash not even worthy of squatting in the home of a great Sha'ir (genie-binder).
