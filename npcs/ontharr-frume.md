# Ontharr Frume
Ontharr is a friendly and hot-tempered human paladin whose massive beard conceals his [Order of the Gauntlet](../articles/factions/order-of-the-gauntlet.md) pendant. He is often wearing plate armor resplendent with a sun-and-star motif, the emblem of his hometown.

Ontharr serves as the resident head of the Order in Elturel, capital of the theocratic nation of Elturgard in the Western Heartlands of Faerun. As a Vindicator, he commands many paladins, clerics, and fighters loyal to Torm, god of justice. He maintains a strong friendship with [Leosin Erlanthar](leosin-erlanthar.md), with whom he nevertheless disagrees on most things.

At the battle of Kryptgarden, Ontharr was grievously wounded and lost an arm, though he made a full recovery with the aid of some of the assembled clerics of Torm. As a reward for her bravery in dealing with King Witchthorn, Ontharr gave [Calcey Firecrotch](Calcey%20Firecrotch/%21index.md) an Order of the Gauntlet pendant in the aftermath of the battle.
