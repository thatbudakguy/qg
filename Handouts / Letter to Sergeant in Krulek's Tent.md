# Letter to Sergeant in Krulek's Tent

Type: ✉️ Letter

*Sergeant,*

*You can rest easy about the Welcomers, they've got no beef with us going about our business in Phlan, so long as it doesn't mess with theirs.*

*Alas, I have troubling news regarding the Zhentarim. They fear you've uncovered their spies inside the Black Fist, and are planning a special interrogation should you ever be recaptured. Seems the Zhentilar can worm their tentacles in anywhere - even the dungeons of Valjevo Castle.*

*Be wary!*

*For justice,*

R.H.
