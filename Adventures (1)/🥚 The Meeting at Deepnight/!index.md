# The Meeting at Deepnight

# Hook

When the PCs return to their place of lodging, a note has been left for Peregrine. Bryce Vang has found a buyer for Peregrine's acid-scarred scale armor, but the buyer demands an in-person meeting and refuses to reveal their identity.

When the gang meets the buyer, he reveals himself to be a Harper agent who has been watching the gang. He offers to buy the scale armor at full price and throw in a little extra if they will aid him in kind by participating in a sting. If they succeed in planting the pin, he throws in an extra 100gp. If the gang accepts, they have time to set up the deal whenever is convenient.

The Harper claims that Hagar looks close enough to the merchant who was going to attempt the deal (who was a half-orc) that the buyers won't know the difference. Half-orcs are somewhat hard to come by, and so he assessed this as the best chance to find a trustworthy one to pull off the deal.

# Adjustments

- The Elf buyer asks Hagar "and how is Marona doing?". This is supposed to be a reference to the buyer's mother, whose ill health is the reason that the deal has already been delayed once.
- When the Elf buyer sees Hagar, she realizes that the buyer was supposed to have a broken tusk. Hagar's tusks are intact, and he looks younger than the buyer should be.
- Play the Welcomer thug leader as a bandit captain, and use his half-orc Relentless Endurance ability. He speaks with an Australian accent (The tawl fa paysage outta this baahn is that ihg).
- If the PCs claim they know Glevith, it's a DC 15 persuasion check to convince these thugs that hindering the PCs is a bad idea. Solid roleplaying could grant advantage, however. On a failure, the leader responds: "Half the fucking town knows Glevith's *name*. Doesn't change anything."
- If the Welcomers are engaged in battle and start to fall, some of them will run. If the PCs give chase, use this system:
    - The Welcomers will split up; each PC or group can pursue up to one Welcomer.
    - For each pursuit group, resolve an athletics contest. The contests work on the same system as death saving throws: 3 strikes either way ends the chase.
    - If two or more PCs are chasing a single Welcomer, use the highest score.
