## Background

Between Bryce Vang's armory and Alero's smithy (the "sword" and the "shield") on Steel Avenue are four buildings, each of which takes up one corner of the intersection. In the Southwest corner is a half-timbered building with a crumbling roof and boarded-up windows. One Black Fist sentry is posted outside the door, and another lounges in Vang's "backyard".

Krulek found this building while investigating the collapse of its floor while still working for the Fists, during his campaign to out the Cadornas. At the time, some lesser members of the Cadorna clan lived here, unaware that underneath their property was the two-hundred-year-old dungeon of a mad wizard. Krulek pulled strings to have the building condemned so that he could search it himself, and it's been vacant since then, since construction projects have all but halted city-wide.

When Krulek first searched the property, he found Gensor's writings - some of which made a study of Tyranthraxus, speculating on the extraplanar origins of the Lord of the Ruins. Since Denlor was dead by the time of Ren's battle with the Great Possessor, Krulek realized that any mage powerful enough to both contact and examine Tyranthraxus must have been the traitorous Gensor, whom he long suspected of being the go-between for Tyranthraxus and House Cadorna. The fact that the current occupants of the property were Cadorna descendants only confirmed his theory.

What Krulek didn't uncover was that Gensor was also a rogue member of the Cult of the Dragon. Believing himself a modern Sammaster, the mage felt sure that he was close to uncovering the secrets to creating a Dracolich, and that Tyranthraxus's power over the bronze dragon he used as a vessel held the key. He groomed the green dragon Raaxil to ascend to power while advising Porphyrys Cadorna. When Ren's gang defeated Tyranthraxus and the spirit vanished, Gensor had no choice but to kill Raaxil, his plan to create a Dracolich foiled.

The first floor of the building is a typical single-family dwelling, with a large bedroom containing several beds, a single kitchen, and a family room with wooden furniture in various states of disrepair. In the kitchen, a gaping hole in the floor is just large enough for a creature to drop down 8 feet into a lightless subterranean ruin - the first floor of Gensor's apartment. The second floor of the building is an empty shell, the roof having caved in months ago.

## Outside

A different guard is assigned front-of-house duty each day. The guard sits on a wooden stool in the street watching foot traffic in both directions, clearly bored.

Another guard is assigned to wait in Vang's "backyard" in the event that someone attempts to enter the house via the rear door.

## First Floor

Everything here has been thoroughly picked over by both the Welcomers and the Black Fist - nothing of value remains.

### Family room

This large room, about 40ft square, is full of broken wooden furniture and tools. A large, heavily scratched wooden table dominates one end, with bolts of cloth and small metal tools strewn across it. In front of the table are two large wooden rack-like structures with ratty threads strung between them, their color faded. Arranged facing the racks are an assortment of crude wooden chairs. The floor of the room is covered by two massive carpets, which must have looked beautiful once but are now marred by years of foot traffic and faded from exposure. Just inside the door to the left, a ladder leads to the second floor.

### Bedrooms

These cozy rooms have wooden beds still made with dirty and faded sheets, sitting atop similar carpets to the family room. Both rooms have a large wooden chest of drawers against the northern wall. The room with multiple beds contains an assortment of children's clothing and shoes in the bureau, but nothing else of interest. On top of the bureau in the master bedroom are a strange mix of baubles - a bone comb, a small knife with the initials *G.C* engraved in the handle, and a small framed hand-drawn portrait of an officious-looking man with a queasy smile wearing billowing black robes. On the back of the portrait are the words *Porphyrys Cadorna - First Councilman of Phlan, 1340 DR*. This can be found with a DC 10 perception check.

### Kitchen

The tiled floor in this room shows it was likely used to prepare food. Large wooden shelves, now thoroughly emptied, line the walls. A few cooking implements are rusting on a low table against the Southern wall. To the West, a pair of wooden double doors are visible, with a large and suspiciously shiny-looking padlock connecting two bolted-on metal plates across the front. The lock can be picked with a DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or broken open with a DC 21 strength check. Breaking open the plates alerts both of the Black Fist guards, if they are present. Through the pantry doors is a small 10-by-10 foot room lined with wooden shelves. The floor has caved in, creating a gaping hole just large enough for a medium-sized creature to pass through.

## Basement

These rooms are much (hundreds of years) older than the house that was built atop them. Gensor didn't keep many valuables here, as he preferred to conduct his research in the Welltran crypt once it was built, but he did leave behind some writings that Krulek considered a smoking gun.

### Library

This room was a staging area where Gensor assembled materials to bring into the Welltran crypt, and the place where he kept most items he wanted to hide from Raaxil (because they pertained to his studies of Tyranthraxus). It served mostly as a library, containing tomes on everything from necromantic magic and the history of Sammaster's life to histories of the Moonsea and speculation about the origin of extraplanar entities.

Bookshelves dominate the southern, and northern walls, with two large leather-backed chairs atop a rug even more threadbare than those on the upstairs floor. The room is coated in a thick layer of dust, but tracks are visible that run from the hole over to the bookshelves and to the eastern wall, ending there abruptly. To the west, a low wooden writing desk is strewn with scraps of paper and quills. The walls are brick, with the eastern fully exposed. Two carpets, perhaps used as tapestries, lie crumbling on the floor at its base.

Most of the papers on the writing desk have faded such as to be nearly impossible to read. There seem to be two kinds: notes written in common that speculate as to the nature of Tyranthraxus or describe where his minions laired outside Phlan (at the top), and correspondence written in Draconic in a different hand (lower down). Of each, only one letter is clear enough to be deciphered: see [Letter to Gensor in Basement](../Handouts/%E2%9C%89%EF%B8%8F%20Letter%20to%20Gensor%20in%20Basement.md) and [Letter to Porphyrys Cadorna in Basement](../Handouts/%E2%9C%89%EF%B8%8F%20Letter%20to%20Porphyrys%20Cadorna%20in%20Basement.md).

The books on the shelves are a puzzle that opens a hidden door into the portal room, on the eastern wall. Pulling a book from the shelf causes some of the bricks in the wall to glow, corresponding to the spaces in the passphrase which have the same letter as the first letter in the book's title. The passphrase is part of the famous phrase from the *Chronicle of Years to Come* which was erroneously mistranslated by Sammaster:

DEAD DRAGONS SHALL RULE THE WORLD ENTIRE

The puzzle contains these letters: D, E, A, R, G, O, N, S, H, L, U, T, W, I. A perception check reveals that the books that start with these titles have been more recently moved from the shelves; they are  far less dusty than their peers.

The books with the above titles are:

- *Dragons of Faerun*
- *Entities Extraplanar: A Study with Notes*
- *Algashon's Betrayal and the Triumph of Bane*
- *Reanimation for the Busy Mage*
- *Great Possessor, Flamed One*
- *On Dracoliches*
- *New History of the Moonsea*
- *Sammaster the First-speaker*
- *How the Seven Lost Gods Fell*
- *Lichdom Reconsidered*
- *Urgund's Description of Darkness*
- *The Weave: a Collection of Practical Observations*
- *Whither the Casual Necromancer?*
- *Ill Omens*

Lying open on one of the chairs, obviously recently perused, is a crumbling copy of one of Sammaster's initial translations of the *Chronicle of Years to Come*. It is a side-by-side version with an unknown language on the left and common on the right. The page it's open to is the portion used in the puzzle solution.

### Portal room

When the passphrase is spoken aloud, the bricks in the eastern wall begin rumbling, kicking up a large amount of dust. Slowly, they fold in and slide back to either wall, revealing a 10-foot gap in the wall leading into a small 10-by-10-foot room.

Etched into the slate floor are a series of arcane glyphs creating a permanent teleportation circle, the target of which the PCs have already discovered inside the Welltran crypt. Declan copied out the sigil sequence found in that circle, and can recognize it as such. The teleportation circle does not function, as the rod that linked it to the Welltran crypt version was destroyed when the PCs removed it from the crypt.
