# Hook

Answering Millivent Moss's invitation to celebrate Highharvesttide, the gang travels out to Kabel's Hill to join in the festivities. The Moss Family is celebrating both the successful harvest and the engagement of its eldest son, Volland, to Hadley Scheimer of the Scheimer barley farm.

When the gang arrive, a huge feast has been prepared and set outside the Moss farmhouse on several wooden tables that have been moved into an open field, surrounded by huge stacks of brick-like layers of harvested peat. Two large metal braziers burn smoldering peat fires, and the smell of peat-smoked meat hangs heavy in the air around the farmhouse. Laid out on the table is a simple but impressive feast: roasted and smoked birds along with farmhouse cheese and loaves of fresh bread.

At the table, Declan recognizes several of the laborers he has worked with the past few days. The family seems to be genuinely grateful to share in the harvest's bounty, and the other assembled men tuck into their food with gusto. The mood is cheerful, with Volland and Hadley exchanging mischievous looks at each other across the table. The young girl is wearing a simple white linen dress with a pin of a small sheaf of wheat underneath a rose; Declan and Calcey recognize this as a living version of the holy symbol of Chauntea.

After the feast, the Moss family patriarch Haldred (human male; irish accent) convinces the gang to join him in festivities down at the local watering hole, the Leaky Bucket. He alludes to it having been a "roof coopla tendays, innit" and encourages the gang to blow off some steam: "venturin' ain't easy, leastways not in the moonsea." He does admit he's "damn prood of me boy...boot to have the noight of his loife!" When the PCs get to the Leaky Bucket, the adventure starts in earnest.

things that happen in the forest (malicious actions stop if the PCs treat with the pixies):

- PCs hear babies crying, women laughing, men groaning (always)
- PCs hear a twig snapping and see something huge in the distance moving (always)
- prior to eating each day, serelis sends the PCs out in search of bunchberry (groups of 5-10 red berries on a single stem, low bush with oval leaves). it is a DC 13 nature check to find some.
- on the first day:
    - Whoever doesn't find berries, when they get back checks their pack and finds that it's full of bunchberries already
    - Hagar feels a sensation on top of his head and reaches up to find he has a flower crown crafted to resemble Peregrine's *headband of intellect*
    - Declan notices a strange reflection in his spellcasting focus. When he looks closer, a sunflower blooms in time-lapse inside the crystal sphere (*minor illusion)*. He hears a faint giggling sound.
    - in the evening a pixie casts dancing lights, making them appear as four paper lanterns that slowly drift into the glade in which the adventurers are staying.
- on the second day:
    - when they wake up a pixie has left a small carved image of calcey's face made out of a purple hardwood at calcey's feet. serelis identifies it as morcant burl, native only to the quivering forest.
    - a pixie ties declan's shoes together while the group is resting (e.g. for lunch). DC 12 dex save to avoid being knocked prone, but no damage.
    - a pixie smears honey on peregrine's shoes during lunch, and after lunch he starts to be bit by hungry ants that are swarming him from below.
    - a pixie casts *fly* on hagar while he's sleeping. group perception check with disadvantage, DC 15. if he floats away unhindered, it's 1 bludgeoning damage.
- If spoken with, the pixie has a valley girl accent. it speaks elvish or sylvan.
- on the morning of the third day the displacer beast encounter takes place
- if, after reaching greenhall, the party wishes to continue to Jeny, Serelis does not accompany them. he will wait for them at greenhall instead.

# Outro

Upon leaving Jeny's glade, the party faces the better part of a 3-day journey back to Kabel's hill. They will need to keep themselves, and the two villagers, fed and safe during that time.

The base time to travel from Jeny's glade back to Kabel's hill is 30 hours. Each failed survival check increases the time by 1d4 hours, and each successful check reduces it by 4 hours. Checks can be made three times per day for a full day of travel.

If the party decides to try to go from Jeny's glade back to Greenhall (though obviously not enter it), it will be a DC 14 survival check. On a success, they are able to make it back to Greenhall in about 4 hours. From here, Kabel's hill is 24 hours away.

As night falls on the first day leaving from Jeny's glade, Declan hears a whispering voice in Elvish when taking his watch. Out in the trees, a ghostly form is visible - a thin woman with long, tumbling locks of white hair who peers at Declan curiously. She wears a long grey cloak over a green dress.

The banshee is the shade of Irienden, a female elf of Greenhall who bore the illicit child of a farmer named Korvin from the outskirts of Phlan. She was killed and her child eaten by the spiteful and childless Jeny around 1390 DR, and now haunts the area near Jeny's glade to inflict her sadness on others. She has fixated on Declan as her potential living son.

Irienden begins by simply watching Declan, but can be enticed to come nearer. She will happily speak with Declan, but isn't interested in other members of the party. When she realizes Declan cannot be her son, she grows impatient, pleading with him to stay in the forest with her because she cannot leave. If Declan refuses to stay, she turns angrily and places herself for maximum effect before opening combat with her wail. Following the wail, she uses her horrible visage on whoever is likely to fail the save, and then concentrates on Declan with her corrupting touch.

Once reduced to 23hp, Irienden begins acting erraticly, flying about and grasping at jewelry or other items the characters may be holding, and perhaps tossing them about - maybe Peregrine's *headband of intellect* or Calcey's *ring of fire resistance*.

*"nin red" = my son*

*"cin u nin red" = you are not my son*

*"Hain chil sin cin o nin" = they've taken you from me*

When the banshee wails, some glass items may shatter, including potions of healing that the characters may be carrying. Calcey's magnifying glass cracks, but does not shatter.
