# Camera Controls

1. Turn on the iPad and connect using spacedesk. (Do this before starting OBS!)
2. Fire up TTS. It should automatically use the iPad as the spectator screen. Run at 1024x768 resolution to ensure that your view matches the spectator's view.
3. Change to the black player color so that fog of war, etc. will not affect you.
4. By default, the view tracks yours. To disable this, push right control/command.
5. You can set preset camera locations using ctrl + 1, 2, or 3.
6. To move your camera to those locations, use shift + the same number.
7. To move just the spectator camera to those locations, push shift to cycle through them.
