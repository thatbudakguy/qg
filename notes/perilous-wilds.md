**Undertake a Perilous Journey**
When you _travel through dangerous lands_, indicate the course you want to take on the map and ask the GM how far you should be able to get before needing to Make Camp. If you’re exploring with no set destination, indicate which way you go. Then, choose one party member to **Scout Ahead**, and one to **Navigate**, resolving those moves in that order.

**Make Camp**
When you _settle in to take a long rest_, choose one member of the party to **Manage Provisions**. Then, decide on a watch order. The GM chooses one person on watch during the night to roll +nothing: on a 10+, the night passes without incident; on a 7-9, the GM chooses 1 from the list below; on a 6-, a Danger manifests. You’d better Stay Sharp!
- The person on watch notices a nearby Discovery 
- One party member of the GM’s choice suffers a restless night
- One or more followers causes trouble 
- A Danger approaches—it’s not immediately hostile, but whoever’s on watch had better Stay Sharp anyway

**Stay Sharp**
When you _are on watch and something approaches_, roll +WIS: on a 10+, you notice in time to alert everyone and prepare a response—all party members get to act first; on a 7-9, you manage to sound the alarm, but no one has time to prepare; on a 6-, whatever approaches has the drop on you.

**Scout Ahead**
When you _take point and look for anything out of the ordinary_, roll +WIS: on a 10+, choose 2 from the list below; on a 7-9, choose 1 from the list below; on a 6-, the GM makes a move.
- You get the drop on whatever lies ahead 
- You discern a beneficial aspect of the terrain—shortcut, shelter, or tactical advantage (describe it)
- You make a Discovery (ask the GM) 
- You notice sign of a nearby Danger—ask the GM what it is, and what it might signify

**Navigate**
When you _plot the best course through dangerous or unfamiliar lands_, roll +INT: on a 10+, you avoid dangers and distractions and make good time, reaching a point of the GM’s choosing before you need to **Make Camp**; on a 7-9, the GM chooses 1 from the list below; on a 6-, the GM makes a move.
- You happen upon a Discovery missed by the scout
- The going is slow, or you wander off course. The GM says which, and where you end up on the map 
- You encounter a Danger; whether or not you’re surprised depends on whether the scout has the drop on it

**Manage Provisions**
When you _prepare and distribute food for the party_, roll +WIS: on a 10+, choose 1 from the list below; on a 7-9, the party consumes the expected amount of rations (1 per person if **Making Camp**, 1 per person per day if making a **Journey**); on a 6-, the GM makes a move.
- Careful management reduces the amount of rations consumed (ask the GM by how much)
- The party consumes the expected amount and the food you prepare is excellent—describe it, and everyone who licks their lips takes +1 forward
