# Outline
## Bang
> You appear in an oval cave carved from solid glacial ice, with no passages leading out. The ceiling is 30 feet high and lined with icicles, and bits of broken ice surround a massive white marble sarcophagus situated in the middle of the floor. The lid of the sarcophagus is sculpted into the likeness of a female giant with long flowing hair.

The sarcophagus is 20 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet tall. Dwarvish runes carved into its base spell the name ESCLAROTTA. The lid of the sarcophagus requires a DC 30 Strength check to push aside, and the bones of Blagothkus’s deceased cloud giant wife are contained within. There is no treasure buried with her.

A creature in this tomb that speaks the name “Blagothkus” is instantly teleported to the ground floor of Esclarotta's tower.
## Steering Tower
Blagothkus has secured the door to this tower with an *arcane lock*. It can be opened normally by a giant or by a *knock* spell. For everyone else, breaking it down is largely impossible, because a DC 70 Strength check is required.
> A staircase of ice leads from the tower’s ground floor to a higher chamber, the walls and ceiling of which gleam and glitter: jewels are everywhere in the room. You see glowing moonstones, thumb-sized emeralds, shining silvery mithral wands, and strange spheres covered in turquoise and gold, as well as dozens of copper levers and golden spheres embedded in the walls. After a moment, the walls themselves seem to disappear, providing a perfect aerial view in all directions, as if there were no castle and no cloudstuff around. More than a dozen glowing white runes flicker in and out of existence, drifting about the room like snowflakes.

The magic here now functions intermittently if at all. Esclarotta's spirit has fled, her binding to this world severed by the destruction of the castle.
## Araevin's Research
### Black Dragon Mask
See [Black Dragon Mask](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/black-dragon-mask)
Araevin's assessment:
- A strange item...initially thought it might be a relic of the Dragonfall Wars, yet it's obviously designed for a human. Then again, it seems to be older than the Cult of the Dragon, at least as far as Araevin is aware.
- This mask allows the wearer to assume properties of a Black Dragon, but it's clear that there were once others, perhaps for other kinds of dragons. Further, Araevin got the distinct sense that this item as it is now is in a...fragmented state. That is, there was once only **one** mask. Its ability to change form reflects this.
- It's clear why a human would want this: it grants a significant boon towards interacting with Dragons, who are powerful allies. 
### Hazirawn
See [Hazirawn](../../npcs/hazirawn.md)
Araevin's assessment:
- A relic of Old Netheril, likely forged at the height of the Empire. Such things are worth their weight in gold, and utterly priceless to collectors, but this one would make all but the greediest arcanists wary because of its horrible history.
- The soul inside that blade was bound **willingly**, as one of the great military commanders of the Empire. It had one purpose in life, and it maintains the same purpose now for eternity: killing.
- It emits a strong aura of necrotic magic now, but if it attunes to a willing wielder, its power more than doubles.
- Reveals all properties of the item.
### Globe of Force
has the gems and giant's tools inside; they had it sent up to him
## Message from Aya
Aya contacts Peregrine via *sending* in response to his message to the Lord Sage. Her response reveals something about the trouble in Phlan,
