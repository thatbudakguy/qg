# Outline

## Shopping

Bryce Vang has a *sentinel shield* that he acquired over the winter. The lowest he'd go on that is 750gp. The shield is hammered bronze in a teardrop shape, with the central circular portion bearing a strange painting of an eye. It leaves you with an unsettling feeling. It was brought to him by a strange wizard, who was passing through and bartered it for a large quantity of raw metal materials. Apparently it was acquired in Calimshan.

Alero has nothing new

Fillistrom has a version of *oil of slipperiness* that only does the effect of the *grease* spell.

## Acquiring disguises

The PCs can attempt to purchase reasonable disguises to appear as merchants, either in Phlan or in Waterdeep. Aya has already given the suit of fine clothes, left behind from a previous student, to Sirge, so he doesn't need any. The PCs can make a deception check to decide on the most effective disguise based on what's available.

### Phlan

The relevant business is Randolph Tzintin's (leather clothier), in New Phlan on Maiden Ave. Tzintin is a mousey, nervous man with a long ponytail who continually exhorts the PCs to "mind those hides" and is extremely afraid that someone will touch the hides curing in the air in his small, foul-smelling shop. He does, however, have some fairly nice leathers that a traveling merchant might use to stay comfortable on the road...for a price.

> Indeed, tanning by ancient methods is so foul smelling that tanneries are still isolated from those towns today where the old methods are used. Skins typically arrived at the tannery dried stiff and dirty with soil and gore. First, the ancient tanners would soak the skins in water to clean and soften them. Then they would pound and scour the skin to remove any remaining flesh and fat. Hair was removed by soaking the skin in urine, painting it with an alkaline lime mixture, or simply allowing the skin to putrefy for several months then dipping it in a salt solution. After the hair was loosened, the tanners scraped it off with a knife. Once the hair was removed, the tanners would "bate" (soften) the material by pounding dung into the skin, or soaking the skin in a solution of animal brains. Bating was a fermentative process which relied on enzymes produced by bacteria found in the dung. Among the kinds of dung commonly used were those of dogs or pigeons.

### Waterdeep

<aside>
ðŸŽµ Put on the "Waterdeep in Spring" ambience and switch to the Waterdeep streets scene.

The relevant business (recommended by Madrak and/or Renaer) is Ragathan Furriers, on the east end of Tarsar's Street, near Saerdoun Street and the Swordmaiden. The building is a typical two-story Waterdhavian row house, with commercial enterprises on the lower floor and townhomes on the upper floor.

The proprietor, a thin woman with a grey ponytail and half-moon spectacles named Hazyl Gullscream, is a no-nonsense lady of about 50 who makes no secret of the fact that she has taken over the business from her late husband, the hapless Bertus Ragathan. She continually professes her distate for the trade, but nevertheless has a shrewd eye and drives a hard bargain. She is assisted by a cringing dwarf named Rozag who addresses her as "Ms. Gullscream".
