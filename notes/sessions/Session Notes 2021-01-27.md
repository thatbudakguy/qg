# Announcements

- Review of rules on hiding (PHB 177): you can take the "Hide" action as a regular action in combat, making a stealth check (DM's discretion about when you are allowed to take the action). You remain hidden unless:
    - You reveal yourself, either accidentally or by firing/using a weapon
    - A creature's passive perception exceeds your roll
    - A creature makes an active perception check to find you and beats your roll
- While you are hidden, you have advantage against any creatures that aren't aware of you.

# Recap

[Witchthorn's Oath](../../logbook/Witchthorn's%20Oath.md) 

# Outline

Eiruk contacts them via *sending* once they have a chance to get their bearings: "Hagar, it's Eiruk...didn't find you this morning. What's your status? Shala says we are half a bell away."

Eiruk also tells them that something important is happening today: "Reports this morning say they know something is up. Important meetings for both cult groups. Try to disrupt if you can."

## Areas

### Ruined tower

**Tower**

The PCs start out in the basement of this tower, having been teleported inside by King Witchthorn's reflecting pool. The upper floors are inaccessible, the wood having long since rotted away to leave only the weathered stone skeleton.

**Courtyard**

The only ground-floor door in the tower is to a walled-in courtyard to the north that forms the inner "keep" of the fortress. These walls are higher than the palisade walls of the fortress. The interior looks like it might have been a garden once, but has long since been reclaimed by nature. There should be plenty of statues and rubble here to give the players cover/places to hide.

There are no direct exits from the courtyard, but a wooden ladder up to the top of the battlements. From here, one can access the battlements and all of the other platforms to the north, east, and west via rope bridge.

Zaralda (russian accent) is here, attempting to raise Elven dead where they were buried in the courtyard. If the PCs do battle, she could attempt to alert the hobgoblins, but might be more concerned with saving her own hide. She has two Wights with her, and is in the process of raising more:

> A circle of blood and dust surrounds a weathered stone marker, with a bald tiefling woman in crimson robes kneeling inside it. Standing eerily motionless next to her are two slender humanoid shapes in leather armor, holding rusted weapons. A closer look reveals their facial features have long since rotted away, and the head bears no armor but whited bone gleaming in the sun.
> 

Zaralda stays in the circle for the first round of combat continuing to raise another wight (unless interrupted), and the second round thereafter casts *mage armor* on herself before joining combat. She opens with *blight*, showing no mercy, and thereafter uses *blindness* or *ray of enfeeblement* to take down Hagar.

Zaralda (necromancer statistics) has no intention of being killed here, and will *dimension door* outside the courtyard in order to get away. She alerts one of the hobgoblins that there are intruders in the fortress, but the hobgoblins aren't willing to believe her and she is not determined to get to Garbul, so the alert isn't widespread if this occurs.

**Treasure**

If Zaralda is killed, her satchel contains 122gp and 25sp, a bag of chalk, a small packet of *dust of dryness*, a spellbook bound in drow skin with all her spells, and a note written in Thayan (somewhat interpretable with a DC 18 intelligence check). She is wearing red wizard robes.

The note charges her to make contact with Alandra in Kryptgarden forest on behalf of "The Zulkir in Exile". The note mentions that other cult forces may be at the fortress, but that Zaralda is not to make any deal with them, because the Thayans intend to support the new cult if they are involved at all. The note also mentions "The Zulkir's" desire to know the arcane aptitude of the cultists, because if they are lacking, this bodes well in two ways: it means the Thayans have the upper hand and are needed, and it also means that Tiamat will look more favorably on them once she returns to the Material Plane.

### Living quarters

**Barracks**

10-20 Hobgoblins are gambling or sleeping inside these leather tents, while others mill about outside. Occasionally hobgoblins enter and leave the tents. Inside are wooden bunks for up to 100 hobgoblins.

**Garbul's quarters**

Garbul, the hobgoblin warlord, sleeps here and meets with his lieutenants. There will be guards posted, but Garbul will be meeting with Alandra at the new cult encampment. If the characters are captured, they are taken here to be watched over.

Inside the tent is a chest with Garbul's valuables: A fine pair of warm rabbit fur boots worth 25gp, A fine leather belt inset with an Eye agate worth 30gp, a *ring of warmth*, and 354gp, 122sp, and 33cp.

**Granary/Mess Hall**

This building contains accumulated supplies: cured meat, rations, salt, etc. Much of the meat appears to be from rats, wolves, and other small woodland creatures and is not particularly appetizing. There are some wooden cages containing live rabbits and other small animals. One area clearly serves as an abattoir, judging from the incredible volume of bloodstains on the ground.

### Old cult encampment

One of Garbul's lieutenants, Okurz, is meeting with Thalder (Cult Fanatic) and his attendants (Cultists) here. Thalder can be heard angrily bargaining with Okurz: "with the services of the maimed virulence, our victory is assured! everything has been prepared! For the last time, name your price! It is within my power to offer all the riches of the moonsea, and more." Okurz deflects: "you must be patient. the old one prizes her offspring more highly than any gold, for there is only one, and she shall have no others."

If Thalder is killed or flees before Claugilyamatar arrives, the dragon decides not to lend Vorgansharax to the Old Cult.

**Treasure**

Thalder's satchel contains 42gp and 4sp, a spellbook with all his spells, and the [Letter to Thalder](../Handouts/%E2%9C%89%EF%B8%8F%20Letter%20to%20Thalder.md). His cultists carry 22sp.

### South battlements

One of Garbul's lieutenants, Drog, is manning the siege weapon and training his unit in its use (read: berating them while they clamber about ineffectually). If the PCs are here unobserved, they have a chance to see the siege weapon in action and understand how to use it. Otherwise, checks to do so are made with disadvantage.

### Siege workshop

Several Hobgoblin engineers are working on skeletons for a mangonel and a second ballista here. They are absorbed in their work and will not leave the area until the main assault.

### New cult encampment

Garbul himself is meeting with Alandra (Mage) and her attendants (Dragonclaws) here. This will be the first time the PCs have seen Dragonclaws, but Peregrine will recognize their dress enough to know that they are cultists of rank - no mere initiates.

If the PCs eavesdrop on the negotiations, they will hear Alandra trying to push Garbul to tell Claugilyamatar that the Dragon Mask should be returned to the cult to please Tiamat, because the Red Wyrmspeaker learned the location of the mask from Tiamat herself. Garbul will demand that Claugilyamatar herself be paid tribute, for the return of Tiamat is far from certain, even with a Dragon Mask in the possession of the cult. Alandra will aver that a hoard is soon to be assembled, but that the cult needs the mask to pull off their plans. Moreover, the cult has already brought the Zartruss tremendous resources, and the fortress is nearly complete. The authorities of the sword coast will surely crack down on the wagon thefts soon. Alandra may ask to speak to Claugilyamatar herself, claming she has earned the right, as a wearer of purple.

If Alandra is killed or flees before Claugilyamatar arrives, the dragon decides not to give the green dragon mask to the New Cult. However, during the events of act II, Neronvain convinces Claugilyamatar to give up the mask regardless.

**Treasure**

Alandra's satchel contains 56gp and 12sp, a spellbook with all her spells, and a [Letter to Alandra](../Handouts/%E2%9C%89%EF%B8%8F%20Letter%20to%20Alandra.md).

The Dragonclaws carry a total of 22gp and 10 sp. Garbul is wearing full plate armor and wields a masterwork elven longsword looted from one of the tombs in the ruined building.

### Yard

**Armory**

This building contains many sets of chain mail, shields, longswords, longbows, and arrows.

**Forge**

The Zartruss clan blacksmith is smithing chainmail here, with many half-finished sets of chain, and a few half plates surrounding him.

**Archery range**

One of Garbul's lieutenants, Rezal, is drilling his squad on archery here. Several of the hobgoblins are practicing their archery against ranged targets, while others look on, jeering or shouting as appropriate. Occasionally Rezal intervenes to castigate a soldier who he believes is lacking in ability.

## Developments

### Alert level

If a body or suspicious evidence is found, hobgoblins may debate what to do with each other for some time, but will ultimately find their captain to wait for orders about what to do. Garbul has given orders not to be interrupted during his important negotiations on behalf of the Zartruss clan's patron Claugilyamatar, and the captains will be hesitant to go directly to him, preferring to delegate and cover up any minor incidents.

Any Hobgoblins that are directly attacked will shout "intruders! intruders in the fortress!", rapidly drawing the attention of anyone nearby. If combat breaks out and a captain is not present, the Hobgoblins fight to the death, but if one is, they will prevent warriors from killing the PCs and instead attempt to take them prisoner to bring to Garbul. Someone will be sent to fetch manacles from the armory so that the prisoners can be bound.

### Taken prisoner

If the PCs are taken prisoner, they will be manacled and tied up near the mess hall. Their weapons and packs will be taken and moved to Garbul's tent. Garbul gives orders that he desires to interrogate the prisoners himself, however, so they will be left alone until the main assault occurs. The PCs are guarded by two hobgoblins.
