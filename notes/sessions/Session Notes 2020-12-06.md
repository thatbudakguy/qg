# Outline

## On board the *Kite*

- walt is wearing thick leathers to keep out the foul weather, up at the helm. he inquires after the health of the gang, mentioning that they seemed mostly alright but that Elma can make them something if they have any lingering injuries. he lights a pipe and eventually asks for the full story.
    - about Jeralla: "It is well that her story ended last night. By the sounds of it, she could have been on track to become the greatest threat to the safety of Phlan - and there's a lot of competition for that title."
    - about Sirge: "Can he be trusted on his own? I would offer him work, but we're a tight-knit group, and the season's already over. I'd feel better if you accompanied him; the Moonsea in Winter is a hard place for a Southron youngster."
    - about Sahnd: "A hard end for a hard man. I can't say I'm sorry to hear it." [if they are honest] "his final words give me pause...perhaps we judged him too harshly. Only time will tell. The Sokols have treated us fairly, if not generously. I don't know how I'd face the grace of the moonmaiden without an honest living and this deck under my feet, that's for certain."
- ask the gang what they want to do. anyone who offers to help abovedecks will have that offer gratefully accepted by Walt and Leanne - feel free to let them specify something to do, a check to make, etc. This check can influence the time spent needed to return to Phlan. Alternatively, the gang can spend time belowdecks reading, resting, or in some other pursuit.
- the day passes quickly. Geoffry fetches some tattered leathers from the hold for the gang to wear while they are abovedecks, and the crew of the *Kite* hums like a well-oiled machine: Leanne shouting commands and curses at Geoffry, Sirge and the boys, interspersed with Walt's commands to change course. Elma is not seen abovedecks all day.
- the return journey takes between 12 and 18 hours, owing to the rough weather. the *Kite* arrives in the bay of Phlan sometime on the morning of Marpenoth 27th, with the weather letting up just as the sun breaks over the horizon.
- Leanne takes the gang and Sirge out to the docks in the rowboat. "Hope you won't be too offended when I sugges' you do the rowin', as I'm mostly good fer yellin' and shoutin' at the boys. Can get meself back without a hitch, though." When they arrive, she thanks them for "easiest money we ever made, and no mistake. Anytime you want to come and sprinkle some more gold on us in the offseason you just come down to the docks an' ask the harbormaster if the *Kite*'s in town. Matter of fact, you can come back any ol' time. All Tymora's luck."

## In Phlan

### Cadorna Compound

Belia Barkshine is in, but Braden "has taken ill" and isn't there. His "nerves are quite fragile".

- Collecting the Bounty
    - Belia (gentle Irish accent) is only too happy to hear that the gang have successfully completed their end of the contract. She digs out a note that Braden gave to her to read on the occasion of the gang's return. She also calls in the Cadorna's barrister Thula Copperpot (same clan as Arvin and Harumbr, and their aunt) to serve as a witness. Thula (scottish accent) is a blustery dwarvish woman with reddish-gold hair tied into a tight bun who dresses in a simple tunic. "Sorry 'boot all the red tehhpe!'
    - Belia fetches a large, heavy coin about the size of a dinner plate with a woman's face carved into it from a drawer in her desk. Thula bids the gang come forward and place their hands atop the coin, reading a series of statements to which they need to answer "aye".
        - "Let's try it! What's your name?" [if they don't answer "aye", they "failed the test".]
        - Are yu the parties named in the document afore yu, namely the Quarantine Gang?
        - Do yu swear by gods and men on this holy symbol of the Golden Lady, who adjudicates all fair contracts, that yu have executed the terms of this agreement?
        - Do yu release and hold harmless the parties named in the document afore yu, namely the Houses noble Cadorna and Sokol, from any liability in any harm that comes or has come to ye in the execution of the terms of this agreement?
    - Belia fetches a large leather bag from her desk - "now for the fun part!" - and gives it to the gang. "You're more'n welcome to stay here and count it; I'll only be a little offended! Have a blessed day!"
- Krulek's Claim
    - Belia has no knowledge of anything implicating the Sokols or Cadornas, and if asked, offers her honest opinion that whatever happened 200 years ago is passed - the noble houses today are focused on keeping Phlan wealthy and increasing its status, and they've always treated her fairly.

### Aya Glenmiir's shop

Aya is home. The first thing she asks when the gang comes in is whether her scroll of *feather fall* came in handy, and what the outcome of the expedition was. She seems to think long and hard about the result.

- The Bard Book
    - When Declan produces the book, it flutters open and drifts over to some of the magical items in Aya's shop, evidently curious about them. Aya becomes quiet and serious, asking where they found the book, and who its previous owner was.
    - Aya casts *identify* on the book, if requested. Once the spell is complete, she opens her eyes wide and appears frightened. "This is no conjuration, nor transmutation. The spirit of a creature lies trapped in this object. No sane wizard would perform this magic, and few but the most powerful could perform it without aid."
    - The book angrily flips its pages to read: [not creature. elf.] Aya says she got the distinct impression that the spirit was female.
    - About reversing the spell, Aya knows only that the spirit trapped within the object would likely return to the Astral plane to meet its fate. Other than that, it could be moved to another object or construct, but a body...this she won't speak of.
- Sirge
    - Aya calls him "young master wintermelt" and inquires warmly after her friend Leosin. She chides him for being quite late, "even for a caravan coming from the western heartlands." Any later and he would have been caught in the claw of winter. She asks if he has a message for her.
    - Sirge draws himself up to his full height and says "OK, here goes. Leosin says...something is brewing. It's the Cult of the Dragon. They're acting more...coordinated. But also less. There's all this talk about Tiamat, but some of the communications he intercepts still mention the Dracoliches. It's very confusing. He's looking for connections, junction points. He wants to know how the Cult cells are organized, how they pass messages between the regions, not just towns."
    - Aya says that's certainly useful information, but if he needed to deliver it, he would've probably used something a little faster - so why send Sirge by land? Sirge says he was supposed to use the trip to seek out cult cells in the towns along the way, to find the connection between the Heartlands and the Moonsea. "And did you find any?" Sirge avers and eventually admits he "saw some shady-looking dwarves behind this bar in Daggerford..." but it turned out they were just planning a surprise party. Aya asks if there was any other purpose to the trip and Sirge admits it was supposed to help him "build character and independence as an agent." Aya says that "seems to have worked out wonderfully. Just like Leosin, to send me his best...well, we'll find work for you here, if your friends leave any left, that is." [at this point she has an idea and segues to below]
- Kryptgarden
    - aya received an urgent message from her contact in waterdeep about a tenday ago - actually, just prior to the gang's most recent visit to her. the message called for volunteers to travel far to the West to take part in a special mission. initially, she resisted the idea of telling the gang, because she was afraid for their safety and preferred to have them here to keep Phlan safe. But she gave peregrine the pin because she felt in her heart that the gang was destined for greatness - and no one, including her, could stand in the way of that. So now she's going to be honest - because it might save everyone.
    - [aya serves everyone tea and biscuits. sirge wolfs his down, talks with a full mouth, etc].
    - the assault is planned for the first of Uktar. Once winter settles in, the roads to Kryptgarden will grow impassable, and the hobgoblins will be hunkered down for winter in their new fortress.
    - the harpers are coordinating with a coalition that includes the lord's alliance, the order of the gauntlet, the emerald enclave, and even the zhentarim. the threat of the cult's establishment on the sword coast has pushed these disparate organizations to act together.
    - the expeditionary force being assembled is not quite an army - more of a small cohort of veterans. there's no time to raise a full fighting force, and in any case it's too dangerous - Claugilymatar has laid siege to whole kingdoms and devoured scores of orcs. the only hope is to strike a blow at the cult and withdraw quickly, convincing her not to ally with them.
    - because of the urgent need for expediency, the harpers have arranged for the use of a teleportation circle in a safe house inside Waterdeep that will be used as a staging area. It's operated by a Waterdhavian noble with ties to the Harpers and deep pockets. Aya has received a message with the coordinates to this teleportation circle.
    - she urges them to think it over. no matter what, she tells them to talk to the lord sage - he's the only one who can ensure they make it back to Phlan. she won't say more, but says that he's been working on something he needs to show them.
