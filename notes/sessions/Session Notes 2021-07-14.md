# Outline

## The Southwest Tower

### Centipede Encounter

> As you open the door, something glints in the dim lamplight in the interior of the chamber beyond. Squinting, you can just make out the shining carapace in the corner when something long and wriggling drops down from above, its legs scuttling over you!
> 

The ten giant centipedes attack with surprise the first round. They spread their attacks out randomly.

### Sleeping

Every night the PCs spend inside their room without taking an hour to clean it out, put down straw, and block the leaks results in them needing to make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take one point of exhaustion from the miserable, moldy conditions.

## A Day in the Life

All the characters awake to two loud drumbeats from the drum atop the Barbican, which is used to summon the cultists to work at the beginning of the day.

### Box Building

Hagar and Peregrine have been assigned box-building duty. This takes place in the workshop area in the great hall, and they will be accompanied by several cultists in this work. There are twelve cultist initiates (**Cultist** stats) and four Dragonclaws in the great hall during the day. Most are human, but there's some variety.

A few sample cultists:

- Ootah Gullscream, female half-orc blacksmith from Luskan, obsessed with dragons
- Bree Puddle, female halfling pickpocket from Neverwinter, wants to strike it rich
- Aryanna Cresthill, female human innkeeper from Leilon, just wanted some excitement
- Ariandar Balefrost, male elf alchemist from Waterdeep, on the run from Xanathar Guild
- Warryn Janda, male gnome cobbler from Leilon, needs to support his aging mother
- Shava Mooncairn, female elf butcher from Red Larch, enjoys seeing people suffer
- Micah Swiller, male human pawn shop owner from Westbridge, wants to steal unique items

When Hagar and Peregrine report for work, read the following:

> You enter the Great Hall to find a dozen humanoids in simple, worn clothes laboring over crude workbenches with hammers, nails, and saws. As you watch, a tall half-orc woman puts the final nail in a large open box with handles, tossing it onto a pile of similar containers. Lounging in wooden chairs or picking over the treasure hoard spread out on the tables are four black-clad ranking cultists in masks, their curved dragon-fang daggers clearly visible on their belts. The implication is clear: keep those hands where we can see them, and we're watching you.
> 

**Things to Learn**

- The boxes are for hauling treasure down into the basement, but only the ranking cultists are allowed to do the actual hauling.
- The workers know that the treasure is going to a hoard that's being assembled for the glory of Tiamat, but not where it ultimately ends up.
- Once a new load arrives, it usually takes 2-3 days to build enough hand-held boxes to fit everything, load the boxes, and take them to the basement.
- Either Dralmorrer Borngray or Rezmir herself always accompany the dragonclaws and dragonwings into the basement. Sometimes, the bullywug shaman Pharblex goes with them. Lizardfolk are not allowed in the basement.
- Rezmir is currently absent because she is taking a cut of the treasure to the lair of Voaraghamanthar, the Black Death, but is expected to return that evening.
- The Bullywugs get a cut of the treasure, but all the cultists can tell that it's obviously just the dregs of what makes it here. The Lizardfolk aren't paid in treasure, but in steel weapons.
- The man in red is a recent arrival, but he seem to be close with Rezmir. No one else trusts him or knows why he is here, and the ranking cultists aren't interested. He is staying on the first floor of the keep.

### Cooking

Calcey has been assigned cooking duty. This takes place in the kitchen nearby the great hall. Two other cultist initiates assist the main cook, Tharm Tharmzid, a surly dwarf (pick from the list above if necessary).

When Calcey reports for work, read the following:

> By the dim light of a dirty oil lamp, you take in the cramped and decaying kitchen of Castle Naerytar. Two human cultists in simple clothing are busy stoking a wood fire in the kitchen's small oven, while a dwarf with a stormy expression on his face stands next to the counter, deep in thought. He mutters to himself under his breath "Moradin's beard, I'd kill for a decent loaf ah bread." Noticing you, he looks up darkly. "Who're you then?"
> 

It's evident to Calcey that poisoning the food here will be difficult to manage, since the kitchen is small and the cooks are all in close quarters with each other.

To poison the food, Calcey will need to make two checks: a DC 15 intelligence check using proficiency bonus + cook's tools to carefully undercook the food in a harmful way, and a DC 20 sleight of hand check to conceal what she's doing. If one or both of the attendants are convinced to help, one or both checks are made with advantage (her choice). If Tharm is convinced, neither check is necessary.

If Calcey is discovered poisoning the food, Tharm alerts Dralmorrer Borngray and she's thrown in the prison with the other "spies" for interrogation. If the "poisoning" succeeds, all humanoid cultists will suffer one level of exhaustion for 1d4 days (Calcey rolls). In the morning, it'll be evident from sick faces and frequent emptying of chamber pots into the otyugh's garbage pit that everyone is doing poorly.

**Things to Learn**

- The Lizardfolk stock most of the food in this kitchen, but their ideas of edible food are...not totally congruent with the cultists'.
- The kitchen staff spend most of the day preparing a single evening meal, which all of the cultists eat together in the great hall. Two drumbeats signal the evening meal and end of work.
- Borngray, Rezmir, and Azbara Jos rarely show their faces on this floor of the castle except at mealtime. Rezmir stays on the third floor, and Borngray on the second floor of the keep.

### Interrogation

Declan has been assigned to interrogate Sirge and Leosin, who are prisoners in the northeast tower. Borngray looks for Declan in the tower after the morning drumbeats, but if Declan isn't there, he will seek out Declan to find out what has been learned in the interrogation. Borngray is determined to have a clear statement to give to Wyrmspeaker Rezmir when she returns that evening.

The lizardfolk guarding Sirge and Leosin won't immediately respect Declan's authority, but they can be convinced with a DC 15 persuasion check.

Sirge and Leosin ask Declan for food, since they haven't been fed as part of their "interrogation". Declan can try to get Calcey's help diverting some food to the prisoners - if this doesn't happen, they both have two levels of exhaustion when rescued instead of one.

**Things to Learn**

- The lizardfolk sometimes congregate in the chamber above the forge at night, when the rest of the cultists are asleep. Leosin can hear them talking in hushed voices.
- Rezmir is currently absent because she is taking a cut of the treasure to the lair of Voaraghamanthar, the Black Death, but is expected to return that evening. When she does, Borngray needs to report to her on the status of their captives.
- Dralmorrer Borngray is a member of the Eldreth Valuuthra, an Elven secret society dedicated to wiping humanity from the face of Faerun. Leosin has seen tattoos on his arms that betray this affiliation.
