# Outline

### Aleyd Burral

If shown Thalder's letter, she is grim. If the letter had fallen into the PC's hands even just a few weeks ago, the situation would have been different - she would have been able to take action. But now she's been reassigned, shuffled around to different patrols, and Bolver has been given free reign at Stojanow to manage the prisoners he's supposed to be keeping an eye on. She's suspected he is passing messages to them, or worse. The cultists the PCs brought in haven't been brought to trial - it's been over a month. She can try to get closer to Bolver if the PCs ask her to, but it could be tricky.

Aleyd doesn't know how to interpret Alandra's letter.

# The Black Fist

How many members are in the black fist?

There are about 150 total Knights, roughly one for every hundred citizens of Phlan. Higher-ranking Knights may have squires selected from among the general population of Phlan. The organization is divided into ~10 military units of between 5 and 20 knights who ultimately report to a single commanding officer, usually a Lieutenant. Each unit has between 1-3 sergeants, who are responsible for the day-to-day military readiness of the unit. The executive command is formed from a council of 4 Captains and the Lord Commander, who has ultimately authority over the organization. The Captains serve as aides and bodyguards to the commander, and each serves a different function: the Captain of Chains (Roken Barrelhelm, m shield dwarf) manages prisons and dungeons, the Captain of Swords (Jhessail Greycastle, f human) manages arms and armor, the Captain of Coins (Kynt Daggersharp, m halfling who is in the pocket of the Zhents) manages financial affairs, and the Captain of Spells (vacant since Banite worship was outlawed) manages magic and religion.

How many of those are members of the tears of virulence?

Cron has managed to recruit around 30 hardcore former followers of Bane to his cause. Many of these are concentrated in his unit, but at the advice of his Cult handlers he has attempted to sway at least one member of every unit in the Fists in order to cause maximum havoc when the time is right for Vorgansharax to take the throne. Cron uses occasional patrols with his loyal sergeant Yerk as an excuse to schmooze with knights he's swayed, and bully those he hasn't.

What's Cron's role?

In the beginning, Cron was just another Fist who made his money by roughing up citizens at checkpoints. When the PCs raided the secret prison, they unknowingly wiped out the biggest obstacle to Cron's ascendancy: his superior. Though Levius Coyle would've likely wanted in on Cron's plans had he known about them at the time, his untimely death (and the death of another of the unit's sergeants) created a clear path for Cron to claim a Lieutenant position. Wasting no time with his newfound power, Cron used his ill-gotten gains to pay off one of the Captains to have his unit assigned to prisoner management at Stojanow Gate, seeing an opportunity to make more cash by extorting prisoners for necessities (and their family/friends for visitation). As the PCs continued to put cultists in prison, Cron used the growing population as an excuse to demand more funds (and claimed credit for the capture of Walharrow). At present, he holds the ear of Cpt. Barrelhelm, giving his unit nearly unfettered access to Stojanow as its primary guardians.

What's in Stojanow Gate?

The gate serves as the primary prison operated by the Black Fist for the past century, as the dungeons of Valjevo Castle were supposedly sealed after the defeat of the Lord of the Ruins and rehabilitation of the area by the Emerald Enclave and Kelemvorites. The two towers on either side of the gate rise three stories into the air, with a spiral staircase running up the right-hand tower. Windows are scarce, with the bridge area over the gate having the greatest ventilation and being reserved for political prisoners or those who can afford to be transferred there. The individual cells in each tower are usually reserved for women or other people of some status who for whatever reason can't be thrown in the dungeons below. Underneath the gate is a warren of ancient tunnels, some of which run into dead-ends or meander underneath the buildings of Old Phlan. The main prisoner area is a single large, open chamber down here where prisoners are allowed to mix freely.

What's in Valjevo Castle?

The large walled-in area up the hill from the gate used to be dominated by a maze of poisonous hedges, but after the defeat of the Lord of the Ruins the area was cleared and is now filled in by the various outbuildings of the keep, including a blacksmith, granary, laundry, guard post, mess hall, officer's quarters, and barracks. Above it all towers the massive sheer granite edifice of Valjevo Keep, one of the larger buildings in the Moonsea, though obviously still in disrepair. The damaged Northeastern tower is still covered in the scaffolding from which lord protector Anivar Daoran "fell" to his death. Inside the keep is the Cinnabar Throne room, a massive hall with an impressive granite throne shot through with red, almost blood-like. Petitioners who pass through the Stojanow Gate come here to speak with the Lord Regent and his Council, including the Lord Sage and Doomguide Yovir Glandon.

What's in Valjevo Keep?
