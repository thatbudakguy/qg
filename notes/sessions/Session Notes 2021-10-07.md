# Outline

## Aftermath

### Lizardfolk

- Only a few are left alive. Leaving the castle, the characters will find more member of the tribe, who more or less steamrolled the Bullywugs as they attempted to flee, and now completely control the Mere. Only about 40 members of the Scaly Death tribe remain.

### Bullywugs

- If the characters leave the castle, they will find the huts outside largely abandoned, as nearly all bullywugs have fled due to the death of Pharblex.

### Sirge & Leosin

- Sirge got beat up pretty bad. He's not sure he wants to continue with where the characters go next, and Leosin is inclined to attempt to safely shepherd him home.
- Leosin asks the characters to get a message to Aya Glenmiir explaining that they're in a (relatively) safe location, but they're in need of extraction.

### Treasure
