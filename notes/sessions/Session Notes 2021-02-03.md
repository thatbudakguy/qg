# Outline

## Main assault

Depending on where the PCs are and what they are doing, they may see the main force leading the way, with Order of the Gauntlet fighters in the front charging forward, and arcane barriers flickering around the forces. Read the following if they see it:

> Shouts of "For Elturgard!" ring out as the main force pours through the opening in the wall, arrows flying thick through the air to ping off the heavy armor and shields of the Order of the Gauntlet vanguard. Ontharr Frume himself leads the charge, his long beard flying behind him as he vaults over the wooden planks and barriers with surprising speed.
> 

The hobgoblins react to this direct assault by sounding the massive drums located atop the palisade walls, and moving every available warrior to combat the forces. Any hobgoblins visible to the PCs will head in the direction of the assaulting forces immediately, leaving whatever they were doing, unless guarding the PCs.

The forces will split up in order to cause maximum havoc once they enter the fortress:

- The Emerald Enclave forces (and the Treant) will attack the siege workshop,
- The Order of the Gauntlet fighters will meet the main hobgoblin force at the open wall area,
- The Zhentarim fighters will try to ascend the gate and palisade walls,
- The Harpers will head in the direction of the new cult encampment,
- The Moonstars will head in the direction of the old cult encampment.

Depending on where the PCs choose to go once they exit the keep, they will come upon a battle already in progress involving one of these groups. You can read the above to give them an idea of the chaotic scene visible all around them.

> A wave of Order of the Gauntlet fighters crashes into the area of the goblin barracks, outnumbered 2-to-1 by a horde of angry hobgoblins. Elven archers and druids of the Emerald Enclave assault the siege workshop, wreaking havoc on the half-built weapons. Near the breach in the wall, a treant is tearing down the wooden construction crane the hobgoblins have erected.
> 

Depending on where the PCs end up, you can set up a battle involving the combatants who would be there (and a number of hobgoblins plus archers/captains).

## Claugilyamatar's arrival

At some point after the main force has arrived at the fortress, Claugilyamatar arrives to shake things up.

> A massive shadow falls over the fortress, accompanied by distant screams. Suddenly, a deafening roar and the beat of massive, leathery wings shakes you to the core, the force of it scattering debris and bodies across the ground like trash in the wind. "Behold, wretched ones! The price of your hubris is at hand!"
> 

The dragon opens with her breath weapon, but since the PCs took Witchthorn's bargain, it has no effect:

> A torrent of acrid gas explodes across the ground, withering and rotting all in its path. Yet as you watch, the poison ripples and warps in the air, flowing around you as though held at bay by an invisible field. The dragon bellows in anger. "Witchthorn!"
> 

This sets off another battle, wherein they will try to eliminate the cult leader at either gate, or make their way successfully out of the breach in the wall and rendezvous with Shala.
