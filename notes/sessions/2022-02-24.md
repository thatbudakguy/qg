# Outline
## Bang
> As the balcony of ice breaks away from the mass of the tower, a shower of white explodes into the air, punctuated by the shouting of the soldiers below. You see the wide-eyed face of Tomb Master Colbathin as his grip on the balcony fails, realizing that he is about to take a fall he may not survive. Roll initiative!

[Kinyon](../../npcs/kinyon-colbathin.md)'s fall is 75 feet, and it will take only one round. If he hits the ground, he will take 7d6 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone, likely also breaking a leg.

Characters who wish to help Kinyon but fail could Push their roll (taking a point of Exhaustion), or be offered a Devil's Bargain (perhaps a treasured item falls in the fracas and is destroyed) in exchange for the chance to reroll.

## Araevin's Research
### Black Dragon Mask
See [Black Dragon Mask](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/black-dragon-mask)
Araevin's assessment:
- A strange item...initially thought it might be a relic of the Dragonfall Wars, yet it's obviously designed for a human. Then again, it seems to be older than the Cult of the Dragon, at least as far as Araevin is aware.
- This mask allows the wearer to assume properties of a Black Dragon, but it's clear that there were once others, perhaps for other kinds of dragons. Further, Araevin got the distinct sense that this item as it is now is in a...fragmented state. That is, there was once only **one** mask. Its ability to change form reflects this.
- It's clear why a human would want this: it grants a significant boon towards interacting with Dragons, who are powerful allies. 
### Hazirawn
See [Hazirawn](../../npcs/hazirawn.md)
Araevin's assessment:
- A relic of Old Netheril, likely forged at the height of the Empire. Such things are worth their weight in gold, and utterly priceless to collectors, but this one would make all but the greediest arcanists wary because of its horrible history.
- The soul inside that blade was bound **willingly**, as one of the great military commanders of the Empire. It had one purpose in life, and it maintains the same purpose now for eternity: killing.
- It emits a strong aura of necrotic magic now, but if it attunes to a willing wielder, its power more than doubles.
- Reveals all properties of the item.
### Globe of Force
has the gems and giant's tools inside; they had it sent up to him
## Message from Aya
Aya contacts Peregrine via *sending* in response to his message to the Lord Sage. Her response reveals something about the trouble in Phlan,
