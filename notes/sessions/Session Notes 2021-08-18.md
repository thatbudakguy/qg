# Outline

## Castle Dungeons

You can distribute the player map of the [Castle Naerytar Dungeons](../Handouts/%F0%9F%97%BA%EF%B8%8F%20Castle%20Naerytar%20Dungeons.md) when the PCs descend into them.

The PCs have the option to go Northwest (towards the crane) or Southeast (an area they have not yet explored).

### Northwest

This way leads towards the crane and the drop-off into the mist below. Through a totem companion, Hagar saw that the mist travels forward into another room with two Bullywug guards posted outside.

### Southeast

This way leads initially to the Mud Room, where 5 bullywugs are rolling around.

> 

From there, the PCs can advance to the Centipede Lair.

> The steps to the west descend steeply 10 feet. A lip of stones across the top of the steps keeps most of the mud from spilling down the steps, but enough slops over to make the steps slippery.
> 

Remember that the characters can slip on their way down. In the Mud room,
