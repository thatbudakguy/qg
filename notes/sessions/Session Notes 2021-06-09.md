# Outline

## Arrival

> Shining in the midmorning mist in front of you is a two-story building, its gates open in the front to reveal a large central courtyard with piles of crates and building supplies strewn about. As the shout goes up from the interior, a few curious laborers appear on the second floor balcony that looks out onto the courtyard to observe your approach. On the ground, a burly half-orc with prominent tusks and leather vest swaggers forward to greet foreman Ardred Briferhew, and the few exchange quiet words while the first of the wagons moves into into the roadhouse to be unloaded.
> 
- describe the roadhouse and the rooms
- cargo begins to be unloaded into the courtyard. if the PCs observe, they'll see that most of the things in the courtyard are building supplies, and Bog is ordering the crates to go into the warehouse.
- ardred briferhew rounds up everyone for payment; guards are paid 5gp, peregrine is paid 8gp.
- ardred tells everyone that the crew headed down from neverwinter is late, so the laborers will have a few days to rest up before making the journey north.

## Grudge Match

A friend of the cultist murdered by Jamna has nurtured a grudge against a character since that incident. Now that their load is safely delivered and the mission is complete, this cultist can seek vengeance for her slain friend.

At an opportune time, the cultist tries to goad the character into a fight. She'll use any incident she can from their time together, including the murder, to question the character's courage and fighting ability in front of everyone. If the character refuses to bite, the cultist doesn't back down. The NPC wants blood and won't settle for anything less. She draws her sword and attacks. The cultist uses the stats of a veteran.

As far as the other cultists, teamsters, and hired guards are concerned, this is a personal issue between these two. If the character backs down, everyone assumes the character is a coward and treats this character with disrespect for the rest of his or her time at the camp. If other characters jump into the fight at their companion's side, more cultists do the same (treat them as twelve guards). Bog Luck and Ardred Briferhew prevent anyone else from joining in, but they don't mind watching some limited bloodshed to break the boredom.

The cultist means to kill the character, and she will if she wins the duel (continuing to stab the body after the character is at 0 hit points) and no one stops her.
