> As you catch your breath, you take stock of the situation. Breathing heavily through its mouth, one troll hunches over mere feet away from you, its bloodshot yellow eyes unfocused somewhere in the middle distance. Ten feet away, a drake is making a strange rasping noise you realize must be something akin to a dog's panting, its long scaled tongue lolling out of its mouth, similarly transfixed by a light show that no longer hangs in the air. You become aware of another sound: your own labored breathing. What do you do?

The troll has full HP (84) and the guard drake also has full (22). If they are attacked at all, they come out of their reverie immediately and everyone rolls initiative after the attack is resolved.

## Hunting Lodge

### Staying outside

As soon as any more combat is resolved, Talis becomes aware that she has company outside the lodge and *message*s Trepsin. The four-armed troll exits the hunting kennel momentarily with six ambush drakes in tow to scout for whoever was in combat most recently. The PCs will need to hide to avoid being seen; the easiest places to do that are the woods (bad idea) and the lodge or its outbuildings (better idea). If in the woods, everyone will need to make stealth checks against Trepsin and the Drakes' (one roll) active perception. If Trepsin catches up with the gang, he has orders to bring them to the lodge. He'll ask them for "the sign" first.

### Sneaking in

If the PCs act quickly and head straight to the lodge, they'll likely see Trepsin headed for where they just were, but will avoid him. They can investigate either of the outbuildings, as Trepsin will be out looking for them, or try to gain entry to the lodge.

Their entry options are:

- Front door
- Rear (kitchen) door
- Any shuttered window (DC 10 dex check to avoid banging the shutter)
- Climb to hole on roof visible from outbuildings (DC 15 athletics check)
