# Outline

## Dungeons

> Your guttering torches illuminate the carnage of bullywug bodies piled atop each other, their amphibian blood slicking the dark flagstones of the dungeon floor. For the moment, the caverns have returned to their eery quiet, the only sound a quiet dripping of water and your own labored breathing.

The PCs may elect to search Pharblex's sanctum, which could activate the poison pot trap. Alternatively, they may explore other parts of the dungeon, including the frog lake. Calcey will hear the distant sounds of the Barbican drum (but perhaps not recognize them) very shortly. Then, before long some survivors or stragglers from the battle raging in the courtyard will stumble down into the dungeons attempting to find and alert Pharblex, giving the PCs a chance to learn what is transpiring up on the surface.
