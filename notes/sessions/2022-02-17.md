# Outline
## Bang
> The forms of two Stone Giants, together in death, are crumpled in a heap at the lower end of the room. Their wide eyes and gaping mouths depict the horror of an inescapable doom. The smell of smoke and death from elsewhere in the castle drifts freely in and out of the room's open archways along with the early morning mist. Sitting in the center of the room, and bolted into the icy floor, is a huge cauldron large enough to boil a medium-sized creature, strange runes covering its surface. Near the bodies of the giants rests a massive and dented metal chest, easily six feet long and four feet wide. One of the Vale Guard soldiers shrugs apologetically. "We haven't been able to get it open..."

Once the PCs head back to ground, [Trueshot](../../npcs/kinyon-colbathin.md) and a team of 5 of the Cold Hand will accompany them to try to get to level 2, though they aren't aware of a way to do it yet.
## Araevin's Research
### Black Dragon Mask
See [Black Dragon Mask](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/black-dragon-mask)
### Hazirawn
See [Hazirawn](../../npcs/hazirawn.md)
Araevin's assessment:
- A relic of Old Netheril, likely forged at the height of the Empire. Such things are worth their weight in gold, and utterly priceless to collectors, but this one would make all but the greediest arcanists wary because of its horrible history.
- The soul inside that blade was bound *willingly*, as one of the great military commanders of the Empire. It had one purpose in life, and it maintains the same purpose now for eternity: killing.
- It emits a strong aura of necrotic magic now, but if it attunes to a willing wielder, its power more than doubles.
