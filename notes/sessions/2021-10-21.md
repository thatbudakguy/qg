# Announcements

- Scott is DMing the Halloween session next Thurs! Does Scott need anything from us?
- It's the Steam Digital Tabletop Fest starting today! Lots of fun RPGs are discounted, including old Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights games, which are classics set in the Forgotten Realms. Some are as cheap as $4.
- Nick is working on digitally painting some minis! To make this easier we ideally need minis from sites that have exports that include vertex groups (i.e. not HeroForge). If you'd like, you have the option to make a new mini at [https://eldritch-foundry.com/](https://eldritch-foundry.com/). When you finish, save it and share it in the Discord so Nick can download it using a discount code.

# Warmup

We will answer a question in character. At the end, you (and me) will choose someone who receives inspiration for their roleplaying. You don't have to do it in your character's voice, but it might help!

‚ùì What would your character say to the party with their dying breath?

# Outline

## Castle Naerytar

<aside>
üéµ D&D ambience - generic dungeon (ambience)

</aside>

check in about who is where, and how the party is seeing. the first room the group comes to is the empty room prior to the centipede lair.

### Centipede Lair

if the group with Hagar carries at least one lit torch, the swarms of centipedes don't attack. Otherwise, there are two per PC in this room.

### Mud Room

The stairs up to this room are slippery (DC 8 dexterity check to ascend). Falling causes 1d8 bludgeoning damage and is loud.

> The floor of this room is flooded a foot deep with sticky, reeking mud, making the whole chamber difficult ter¬≠rain.
> 

There's nothing else in the room. The characters will be covered in mud if they stay long.

### Frog Lake

At the landing (area 7), the PCs won't find any more Giant Frogs or Bullywugs, but they will see the bones of larger animals that litter the ground. Most disturbing of all are three sets of iron shackles anchored to the stone, with human, elf, dwarf, and halfling bones. The whole time, Peregrine has the vague suspicion that they're still being watched from somewhere.

Underneath the lake is an underground passage. The passage connects to water south of the bullywugs‚Äô huts outside the castle. Its total length is 300 feet. At 80 feet from the entrance in this pool, the tunnel branches; the left branch leads to the surface and the right branch extends 50 feet to a dead-end. In the pitch blackness, a swimmer has few cues about which tunnel to follow. A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals which tunnel to follow.

### Through the Portal

Courtesy check with the group here about how they wish to appear on the other side of the portal. Current state:

- Hagar is wearing a headwrap covering everything but his eyes, and has the head of a crocodile stuck onto his head
- Peregrine's face is painted to look like a half-orc
- Declan is wearing some vaguely merchant-looking leather clothes appropriate for cold & damp weather
- Calcey is wearing a similar outfit under her leather armor, with her cloak of elvenkind over that
- Everyone is covered in varying amounts of blood in several colors

The portal needs to be activated using its command word. Once this happens, everyone is instantly transported:

> Suddenly the dark dungeon interior is whisked away to reveal a sky full of stars, as you feel your stomach drop out from under you, momentarily weightless and hurtling through some other place at breakneck speed. There is the sensation of a blast of cold air from all directions, and then the vision repeats in reverse, a new picture blooming out of the sky in front of you and snapping back into place along with a violent reintroduction of gravity that throws you down onto your knees into soft grass.

## Hunting Lodge

### Portal Area

<aside>
üéµ Woodland ambience (ambience)

</aside>

> Dark pine woods are all around on the slopes of a mountain valley; the air is cold and fresh. Two ancient stones as tall as Hagar stand to either side of you, and no more than a bowshot ahead along a path is a large house, with stone on the ground floor, timbers above. Within sight are more standing stones. Pine branches shift and sway in a gusting, fitful wind.
> 

The magical gate to Castle Naerytar sits between a pair of moss-covered standing stones visible from all the front rooms of the lodge. Three other portals near the lodge stand between similar stones. One of them connects to the distant north (where Talis visits white dragon allies), one leads to a heavily guarded chamber in Thay, and one leads to the desert of Mulhorand, near a blue dragon lair.

The mossy stones are old and weathered; lichen covers most of their surfaces, but traces of white paint remain in a few of the grooves. The grooves are Espruar (the script used to write Elvish), but very obviously archaic. They mention the ‚Äúsnowy lands,‚Äù an ‚Äúunquiet swamp of mournful croak¬≠ing,‚Äù (the one the PCs just exited), an "endless waste of sand", and the lands of the ‚Äúred sun,‚Äù but provide no place names.

If the PCs linger too long, a patrol of two [Trolls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/troll) and three [Ambush Drakes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/rot/appendix-d-monsters#AmbushDrake) bursts out of the woods. Calcey and Peregrine are not surprised.

### The Lodge

> This ancient building has a wood and plaster upper floor over a fieldstone lower floor: its shuttered windows are all closed. The roof is completely overgrown with moss. A single door stands slightly open. Smoke pours from one of three large chimneys.
> 

Characters can enter the lodge through the front door, the kitchen door, or a shuttered window. Opening a shutter without alerting the lodge‚Äôs occupants requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check.
