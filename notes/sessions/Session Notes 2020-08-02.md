- they search the barn for weapons and tie up the unconscious half-orc
- the gang takes turns examining the egg, and peregrine finally concludes that it's a fake.
- peregrine picks up the fake diamonds and egg while the gang hide the bodies in the hay.
- declan finds a collapsed building in which to perform the interrogation and hagar carries the half-orc inside.
- hagar snaps off a toe and the half-orc divulges that he was hired by the welcomers to get the egg.
- the gang concludes he doesn't have much else of use to offer and debates whether to kill him outright. hagar kneecaps him and stubs out his cigar on the guy's face, at which point he simply passes out again.
- making their way to madame freona's tea kettle; peregrine channels inside the establishment to the astonishment of the other patrons (and embarassment of the harper, who is waiting inside incognito)
- the party returns the egg and is paid in full (150gp), along with a potion of greater healing. they return to the cracked crown and retrieve their items, and then head out to the leaky bucket. they level up.
- stuff half-orc knows:
    - His name is Symas. He and his band of thugs worked as guns-for-hire in Thar until their money ran out, and were now wandering the Moonsea in search of new work.
    - He and his mates accepted a job from Glevith a tenday ago. He was told that some "crazy cultists" were trying to purchase something expensive: a blue dragon egg. The cultists had no regard for their security and would stop at nothing to acquire the egg, making them easy targets.
    - Glevith offered them a huge sum, 500 gold pieces. "Have to be a drongo not to take that!"
    - About how the deal went, he muses "real dog's breakfast, isn't it? sounds loike everybody 'n their mother got hold of the same lousy information."
    - About Glevith: "guess he's a few stubbies shor' of a six-pack isn't he?"
    - My mates were a roight buncha cockies, but i won't ever get 'em back.
