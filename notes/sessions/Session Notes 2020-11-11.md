# Announcements

- Character backgrounds are ready to share
- Character narratives have been sent; DM me to discuss edits/changes. Remember this is just my view of your character, I did it to help me get inside their head but my word is not the law.
- Anything in either of the two docs that you would have reasonable knowledge of, I can tell you about, or tell you to go read X wiki page. Do not hesitate to ask
