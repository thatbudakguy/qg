# Outline

## Waking up

- level up stuff
- Declan wakes up without *detect magic*, to convince himself it's gone he tries to recall it anyway and...realizes he can *see* the weave. Looks at his ring of evasion; sees faint aura of abjuration magic, "thread" from the ring up to his heart. blocked by clothing.
