## Roarke House

As the PCs figure out what to do with the remainder of their night, Madrak pays them a visit. There's a gentle knock on the outer door to their chambers, and the old halfling appears. He gives them a [Map of Waterdeep](../Handouts/%F0%9F%97%BA%EF%B8%8F%20Map%20of%20Waterdeep.md) along with a copy of the [Waterdeep Code Legal](../Handouts/%F0%9F%93%9C%20Waterdeep%20Code%20Legal.md). Madrak speaks with a soft, high british accent, enunciates clearly, and refers to Renaer as "Lord Neverember".

Madrak offers his apologies that Renaer is not more knowledgeable about the gem trade, but expresses his confidence that anything can be found in the City of Splendors - though maybe not on a single night's notice. In any case, he conveys that Renaer's friends often shopped at Halazar's Fine Gems, the storefront belonging to one Stromquil Halazar, guildmaster of Waterdeep's Jeweller's Guild. Madrak also cautions the group that if they are carrying Moonsea currency, it may be looked on oddly by some Waterdavian businesses (and likely won't be accepted by hire-coaches and drays).

He also passes on Ren's advice that if they can't find what they're looking for at the right price, they might try his old friend Parlek Lateriff, who lives on Mountainside. Parlek's chief interest is rare magical tomes, but he ran a brisk business counterfeiting jewelry for nobles some years ago, and trades in whatever he can get his hands on. Madrak mentions that Ren says to remind Parlek he "still owes Lord Neverember for the final volume of the *Annals of Kyrah*", in case it helps the PCs get what they're looking for.

Madrak points out both locations on the map:

- Halazar's Fine Gems is located on the northwest corner of Julthoon Street and Shield Street in the Sea Ward, in the shadow of the God Catcher. It has an instantly recognizable storefront, with glistening black glass that is always sparkling clean.
- Parlek's house is on the west side of the The Rise in Mountainside, south of the Lady Dreaming. It has a balcony on the second floor that is visible from the street, and is likely to have all the lights off, as Parlek prefers to keep it dark. He's known to be cranky with visitors, and the gang may need to be creative to get his attention, but Ren's name should help.

If the PCs ask about enchanting options, Madrak reminds them that any such operation would likely take substantial time, but also recommends they speak to Eiruk Weskur about it tomorrow morning as the group ventures North.

## Halazar's Fine Gems

Approaching Halazar's shop from the North, the PCs will eventually sight the God Catcher, one of Waterdeep's walking statues. This one takes the shape of an idealized human male figure, reaching upward with its right arm and gazing towards a huge sphere floating just above its outstretched right hand. The figure has sunken into the ground nearly up to its waist, but remains taller than the surrounding buildings, at least six to seven stories high. Scaffolding and stairs are visible climbing its arm in the direction of the sphere.

The gem store is exactly as Madrak described, with opaque black glass on one side of the door. The other side has a sort of open glass case, where a diamond the size of a man's head floats gently above a velvet pillow, rotating very slowly in the cold air. If the PCs touch the diamond, they receive what feels like a mild electric shock, as the illusions siphons a little of their energy to keep itself powered.

The shop's interior is nearly as austere as its exterior. A handful of large, exquisitely cut gems rest on black velvet pillows at the top of pedestals about two feet off the ground. Both the floor and the walls are made of a black stone polished so smoothly that the dim, heatless light of a magical torch beside the door glitters off of the reflective surfaces, creating a "disco ball" effect that covers the room in iridescent patterns. The noise of the street is almost totally muffled, and it's a few degrees warmer in here.

A thin man with an even thinner mustache wearing a purple silk robe is bent over a large wooden desk in the back of the shop, and does not look up when you enter. Lifting up a small hinged portion of the front counter, a pretty halfling woman wearing a large necklace set with sparkling black gems hurries over to you. "Good even and welcome! Please don't hesitate to let me know if I can be of assistance." She interrupts frequently regardless to fawn over the PCs, feign interest, and suggest how good some of the gems would look on them. She will assume that Declan is a noble looking to craft some fine jewelry, perhaps for a potential marriage: "are we purchasing for ourselves, or for...[looks at calcey]...someone special today?"

The shop has most gems the PCs could wish to purchase, and Marget will be only too happy to discuss the gems' provenance. Most are from points north, such as the Dragonspines and Spine of the World, but others were recovered from the tombs of Liches or ancient cities, etc. If they request to purchase "300gp worth of diamonds", Marget can go behind the desk and quietly confer with Stromquil, who furrows his brows at this suggestion. With exaggerated slowness, Stromquil fetches a single diamond from inside the desk, weighs it, and hands it to Marget without a word.

If the PCs attempt to deal with Stromquil directly, he is haughty, with a manner reminiscent of Mr. Potter, and professes his core business ethos: quality over everything. The PCs can simply shop elsewhere if they don't believe this. If they ask for recommendations, he brusquely suggests they give the Market a shot. If they attempt to examine any of the gems in the shop with the naked eye, a DC 10 investigation check will reveal that they are of surpassing quality, but that the prices listed are also astronomical - well over three times what might be considered reasonable.

## Parlek Lateriff's House

Approaching Parlek's house from the North, the PCs will sight the Lady Dreaming, another one of the walking statues. Coiled around the buildings of Mountainside, the Lady is supine, her head resting on her hand, as though she has fallen asleep in her garden. She has noble elven features, illuminated by the lights of the small community of Mountainside around her.

Parlek's house is dark, as Madrak mentioned it likely would be. The large two-story front has windows with heavy curtains drawn on the inside, and a small balcony above the front door. It is free-standing, unlike most of the buildings in the main part of Waterdeep, and the PCs can move around to get a better view. All windows are similarly occluded, but there is a coach-house to the north of the main building. A view inside shows darkened rooms filled nearly to the brim with all manner of junk, much of it evidently antique furniture. This is Parlek's "annex".

The main door has a door knocker â€“ a crude iron sculpture of a bird's head set atop a large plate of iron. It makes no noise when knocked, but immediately alerts Parlek, who parts the curtains and peers down at the PCs from a second-floor window. Parlek is an elderly man with a close-cropped grey beard who struggles to find his spectacles. He refers to any of the PCs indiscriminately as "boy". Depending on what the PCs say or offer, Parlek may let them in by waving his hand and unlocking the door below - or he may not.

Parlek wears a tattered silk robe and slippers around the house, and his house consists of a maze of ridiculously slim rooms, which one wouldn't expect from the outside. Nearly all of it is kept dim or dark at all times; Parlek walks with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff that emits a gentle light. He asks them not to touch anything, and unkindly adds to Calcey "*especially* you! don't think I don't see how you're looking at my things."

Initially, to talk, he will lead them to the parlor, which is fixed up with several ornate but threadbare sitting-couches and heavily curtained. If a deal is struck, he leads them to a larger room in the rear of the house with two work tables, on which are smith's tools, vises, and some in-progress works: a set of bracers and an amulet. There's also a long plank holding many gems of various colors, large and small.

Parlek can supply the PCs with 300gp of *real* diamonds, but won't do so for any less than 375gp, as he effectively "rations" the real ones into his creations to keep up the appearance of true glamour, and they're hard to come by. He is interested in nearly any magical artifact, however, and would accept a trade for the PC's emerald necklace, no-questions-asked. He happily identifies said necklace as the *Heart of Myth Drannor,* an heirloom of Moonsea nobility, and is clearly covetous of it because he knows he could resell it here.

If the PCs reveal the Book, Parlek is at first consumed with curiosity, but after casting *detect magic,* he grows suspicious and silent, refusing to bargain for or discuss the book, and remains so unless the PCs offer a satisfactory explanation for owning an item that is the target of an *imprisonment* spell.

If the PCs mention Ren's tip about the *Annals of Khyra*, Parlek grows irate: "that conniving little thief! all a friend means to him is a open purse and a kind word. how his ilk got to be so stinking rich i'll never understand." He rails for some time before eventually deflating: "but I shouldn't involve you in our little...business. You seem like fine enough people. Fine. Tell Renaer to consider my little debt repaid." This will aid the PCs somewhat in whatever deal they're attempting to make, but not much.

Parlek's greed outweighs his annoyance at dealing with PC's Moonsea currency, and he accepts coin without asking twice. However, he'll be happier to make a trade for something he considers truly interesting.
