# DM Notes

- Mother Faral, elf ranger of the Snakewood, and father Ernest, a traveling human wizard
- Dad wasn't around a whole lot and mom couldn't really take you with her because she was supposed to guard various people from snakes and giant spiders, so eventually gave you up to work at Twilight Hall, the temple of Deneir and a Harper base.
- Leosin decided to take you on as an apprentice because  you showed promise hunting/tracking and resilience.
