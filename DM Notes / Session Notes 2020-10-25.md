# Adjustments

- Walt orders the sails to be reefed so the *Kite* can maintain its distance while the gang figures out what they want to do and how they plan to return to the ship once their mission is complete. Walt needs to know:
    - How the *Kite* will know when to pick them up
    - Where they expect to be picked up
    - How long Walt should wait for a signal
- Make perception checks for the kobold sentry and Kai Tyran Uviel to see if they notice the *Kite*'s green sail.
    - If Kai notices, he discreetly informs Sahnd, who doubles the guard at the longship to four in case of an assault by sea. Sahnd is able to recognize the crest of house Sokol, which makes him incredibly suspicious. If the gang confronts Sahnd, he asks how much the Sokols are paying them, and offers to double it if they don't kill him.
    - If the Kobold sentry notices, he informs Jeralla, but she doesn't take any action because the Kobolds don't recognize the device on the ship's sail and don't immediately assume it is hostile.
- If the gang wants to approach via land, the *Kite* will need to either pass by King's Pyre or backtrack to find a suitable location to offload them in a dinghy.
- Use max HP values for all combatants the party engages; this is intended to be a difficult adventure.
