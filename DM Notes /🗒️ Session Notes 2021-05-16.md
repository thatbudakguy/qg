# Outline

## Caravan Court

Once the PCs identify Leosin, they can learn from him:

- Overhearing some of the cultists talking, it's clear that the cult has been busy in the western heartlands, especially in the greenfields. Many small villages were attacked, and Greenest was only the largest.
- Two of the individuals traveling with the caravan were suspicious: a man with a large wool cap and an accent who is trying hard not to draw attention to himself, and a wily gnome that was paying too much attention to Leosin.
- Leosin strongly suspects the gnome is onto him, as he's seen her watching him when the caravan stops to rest. This scrutiny coupled with the hard schedule expected of a guard left virtually no time to contact Aya. He hopes she understands.
- The half-dragon is someone of great power and importance; she was clearly in command. She's also carrying a magical item of intense power. Wherever she's headed, it's worthwhile to follow her. If Leosin leaves the city now, he might still be able to pick up her trail.

### Heading north

> The wagons are moving again! We need to follow them, but I can't risk letting that gnome know that I'm still on her trail. Can you tail them, and I'll follow behind you at a safe distance?
> 

The gang will need to trail the wagons at a safe distance to head north. Follow too close, and they risk being seen; follow too far behind and they risk losing sight of the wagons. You can have them make perception checks to keep the wagons in view, deception checks if discovered, and athletics checks to move through the crowds to keep up.

## Cult Warehouse

Once they arrive in the North ward, the cult group take their horses to a warehouse on Thunderstaff way to unload their cargo and then take the horses off to a stable. At the warehouse, there are many laborers loading crates off of other carts in attendance. At the warehouse in the North Ward, the PCs can learn the following:

- The warehouse in question is one used for stockpiling building supplies that are sent north on the High Road, either to rebuild Neverwinter or the road itself.
- The High Road Charter Company is a consortium of guilds and noble houses, associated with the Lord's Alliance and nominally owned by the Neverembers.
- Peregrine's former cult handler, Varick, is supervising a lot of the loading of crates.
- One particular man, Ardred, tells many of the laborers moving the crates to come back at sunup if they're interested in employment as guards headed north.

Leosin is determined to go after the half-dragon, knowing she is the key to whatever's happening with the treasure, but he urges the PCs not to lose sight of the treasure, as it'll likely lead them to the same goal. Leosin asks Sirge if he wants to accompany him; Sirge in turn asks the gang what they think. In any case, Leosin sets off immediately to find mounts; since the PCs can follow the treasure, Leosin doesn't want to waste a moment.
