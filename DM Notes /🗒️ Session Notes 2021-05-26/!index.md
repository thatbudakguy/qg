### Calcey's papers

The papers calcey took from the desk appear to be part of a company ledger. They record recent events, up until the day they were taken, noting the origin and destination of each shipment managed by the company. Any character can make an investigation check to gain more information from the papers:

- This must have been the top of the ledger, since the events are recent, and recorded often. The theft is likely to have been noticed.
- The most often recorded destination is Neverwinter, followed by the Carnath Roadhouse. There are a variety of origins up and down the Sword Coast and even some cities to the East; most are large recognizable names like Baldur's Gate.
- A responsible party/contact is listed for each shipment. For several shipments, including a few in the past few days, this person is Varick. The shipments managed by Varick have multiple origins and don't seem to follow a pattern.

### Getting employed

If the PCs come back at dawn to get employed, use this table adapted from "On the Road":

Instead, the PCs may decide to try to embed with the convoy and claim they are headed to the Roadhouse or Neverwinter as well. This can be accomplished via a persuasian check or similar with Ardred, who is rounding up the convoy in the morning. Varick is nowhere to be seen, having supervised the unloading and returned to other business in the city.

Ardred Briferhew commands the entire convoy. It consists of six supply wagons (three of which are cult contraband), twelve escorts (including the characters and Jamna), and two dozen laborers marching out to relieve a group that is coming back to Waterdeep for some time off.
