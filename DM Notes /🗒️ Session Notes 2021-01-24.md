## Entering the Forest

The PCs will need to make DC 12 survival checks to orient themselves and head in the general direction of Witchthorn's glade. Each failure costs 1hr of time. After two successful checks, they arrive at some ancient elven ruins. 

> You travel in the direction Shala indicated, and every hour that passes takes you deeper into the gloom of the forest. The further you go, the thicker and closer together the trees grow, and soon a fog hangs in the air, tinged with the acrid smell of poison. A breeze wafts through the trees, becoming colder and more haunting as you travel. You're still some distance from the area of King Witchthorn's glade when you happen upon a small clearing. The few shafts of light that reach the ground are a sickly emerald green. In the center of the clearing is a weathered arch made of stone, covered in vines.
> 

A DC 15 history check reveals the arch was probably part of the one of the Elven kingdoms of Illefarn or Rillithar, which flourished here millenia ago. It has no magic left, but a DC 12 arcana check reveals it may once have served as a teleportation device.

As the PCs are examining the arch, they hear sounds from ahead, crashing through the underbrush. Several humanoids are engaged in a chase, and they're getting closer. The PCs have time to hide, if they want. A perception check can reveal more information about who is coming, depending on the roll: two hobgoblins and three satyrs.

## Satyr Battle

After a few moments, the combatants appear: the hobgoblins on foot, one with an arrow embedded in its armor, running desperately. Use this opportunity to show the PCs tokens for each combatant. If the PCs do not intervene, the hobgoblins use the arch for cover and try to make their stand in the clearing. The satyrs use their bows from a distance, eventually closing to finish the hobgoblins off with their swords and ram attacks.

When one hobgoblin is left, he calls for help. The satyrs (Gilius, Bastus, Nemius) speak in mocking voices. The satyrs laugh cruelly, but occasionally hack and cough to indicate their corruption. When the finish off the hobgoblins, if no one intervenes, one plays a tune on his panpipes: "na na na na....hey hey hey goodbye". If the PCs do nothing, one of the satyrs will eventually head in their direction, or say "I have a creepy feeling like we're being watched..."

### Developments

If the PCs ask about witchthorn, one of them makes a joke about them being "arch-fey" because they're by an arch...but they say they serve claugilyamatar now. Describe the corruption visible on them: they're super gaunt, and have green growths and boils on their faces that they itch at. Green moss grows in the short hair on their bodies. A DC 14 arcana or nature check reveals they've been corrupted by the presence of a great evil.

The Satyrs attack eventually unless the PCs present some reason for them not to, but flee when reduced to half health. If interrogated they reveal what they know about witchthorn's location. The satyrs have coin pouches totaling 40gp, and the hobgoblins have 12gp, iron longswords, and banded armor.

## Princess Ishaldra

A well-trod track is visible leaving from the arch. The PCs continue on in the direction of Witchthorn's domain, and not long after leaving the arch, the ground begins to slope downward.

> At first you resist the direction, afraid that it will lead you away, but the woods slope down and down, until you're quite sure you'd be far below ground level at this point. The atmosphere steadily darkens - it should be midday on clear winter day, but the ambient light level is getting lower and lower.
> 

As you travel around a ridge, the path ends suddenly at a wooden post with two signs. One says "Princess Ishaldra" in sylvan (semi-readable with a DC 15 int check if you know elvish), and the other is featureless. The satyrs will read/explain if they are along, and happily encourage heading in that direction. The signpost radiates powerful conjuration magic.

> The path winds into a small, tree-lined clearing, but it looks like something from a nightmare. A sickly-green, foul-smelling brook borders one side of the clearing, and trickles through a broken dam to flow over several trees, all of them dead, save one. The once-mighty oak tree still lives, though its branches are bent and gnarled by thorny vines growing out of the foul waters; their thorns digging into the tree’s bark. The same vines bind a fey creature to the tree. She lies motionless as thick, black liquid streams from her eyes.
> 

If the PCs approach, the treant animates and attacks, but its attacks are made with disadvantage due to the corruption. The dryad is restrained unless freed, and can only use its *fey charm* ability on someone strong to send them towards the water to clear the vines. Its tears are sap, and it can't speak but gurgles and groans. A DC 15 perception check reveals it's asking for water in sylvan. The satyrs won't assist, claiming the treant and the satyr are "one of us now"!

The characters can take several actions to remedy the situation:

- Restoring the flow of the brook (2 successes): Logs have damned the brook, causing the waters to spill over the side. A character entering the poisonous waters takes 3 (1d6) points of poison damage each round. Freeing the log jam requires two successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) checks. Players may also come up with other options for the brook, such as diverting the waters away from the treant or by using a spells such as purify food and drink.
- Freeing the treant (1 success): The thorny vines influencing the treant can be removed with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. When the vines are removed, four twig blights drop down from the treant’s branches and fight the party. This does not occur if the characters killed the twig blights in the treant’s branches, as detailed below. If the dryad is still bound to the treant when the treant is freed, it will hold still.
- Healing the dryad (1 success): The dryad’s corruption is cured if she is target by spells such as cure wounds, healing word, lesser restoration, protection from poison, remove curse, or the like. Though it will not remove the taint of corruption, the dryad can be freed from the treant by removing the vines as described in “freeing the treant,” above. If the treant has not been cured of the corruption, all of these checks are made with disadvantage due to the treant’s thrashing. Once cured, the dryad’s eyes clear and she is able to pry the vines clear from her mouth so she can speak and aid the party. If the treant is still alive and not yet freed from the corruption, she will ask the characters not to harm it further and suggests how to free it. This will grant advantage on checks made to remove the vines if they do not have it already.
- Killing the twig blights (1 success). Though the twig blights are in the higher branches of the treant, the characters can attack them with ranged attacks. Should the characters do so, four of them drop down and attack the party.

During the encounter, the characters have a chance to notice a scrying sensor. Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 15 or higher notices it. Similarly, any character actively searching for the sensor notices it with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check:

> Shimmering in the air is a translucent, fist-sized orb floating approximately 25 feet above the ground and just as far away. A scant heartbeat after you notice it, it winks out of existence.
> 

### Developments

- Treant killed: if the Dryad is alive, she attacks the party and fights with advantage until death.
- Dryad killed: if the Treant is freed, it mourns the loss of the Dryad and tells the PCs to visit Witchthorn to inform him.
- Both killed: with her last breath, the Dryad tells the PCs how to visit witchthorn: "write my king's name on the sign, and the forest will guide you to him."
- Both freed: the Dryad casts *goodberry* and apologizes to the party. She can accompany them if requested, and the treant will join in the assault if the PCs ask it or inform it of their plans: "nothing lays waste to a keep's gates like a treant!"

## Shady Glade

As soon as the PCs write their destination on the sign, it spins around the post several times before finally coming to a stop. In the direction it points, the trees bend over each other to form a hollow tunnel where the gloom gathers, creating a black pathway leading deep into the darkest valley you’ve yet seen. Small motes of purple-black light fade in and out along the path’s edges.

> Purple motes float in and around black twisted trees, and the cold whispering wind chills you to the bone as the trees open and you find yourself in King Witchthorn’s glade. The sky above shows a moonlit night, full of stars. Hundreds of unseelie fey creatures of all kinds and sizes turn to look upon you with great interest. You see the panther-like beasts you met in the Quivering Forest, their spiked tentacle pads waving lazily in the air. Beside them are massive black dogs the size of a man, their strangely intelligent eyes glowing coal-red. Great crowds of elves, their skin a dusky black and their hair stark white, whisper to each other and stare as you enter.
> 

> Sitting upon a throne carved from bone and polished wood is a slender man, twice the height of any mortal. His torso is bare, and thorny spikes protrude from his shoulders and arms. Only a loose wrap of moss covers his lower half, which ends in shadow. His dark and sinister face is devilishly attractive, framed by a mane of green leaves from which curl two large and bestial horns like those of an ancient ram.
> 

His dark eyes turn to you with an expression of annoyance. "To what do I owe this...intrusion? I do not recall offering any gift of passage."

He can "smell the hag's curse on them".

King Witchthorn can reveal the following, if asked:

- He once courted Claugilyamatar, but their relationship ended less than amicably. "Once I thought her a fine partner, but we were no match. She cared too deeply for her offspring, and not enough for the land that sustained her. Endless days passed as she spied upon the mortals in their cities, whispering to herself dreams of nobility and intrigue. She cared nothing for my court, the one I have held here since these trees were saplings."
- The corruption is due to Claugilyamatar's growing power, and the hobgoblins' disregard for the forest. "They fell trees relentlessly, and strip the ground bare to forge their weapons."
- He loved Ishaldra. "My better half. Would that we could have been."

### Witchthorn's Favor

If the PCs manage to convince Witchthorn that Claugilyamatar threatens his domains, he asks them for a favor.

> Very well. I can shield you and your allies from her attacks. I can tell you why the Cult of the Dragon is here. And, I can give you a way into the stronghold. All I require is a gift in return. I will need a pledge from one of you. You will be oath bound, that I may call upon you at a later time of my choosing. Now...who shall pledge themselves to me?
> 

King Witchthorn uses his powers to read the minds of each of the party members, extending a single hand to rifle through their memories like a desk drawer. The experience is profoundly uncomfortable, as though a pair of cold hands are shoved into one's head.

**Hagar**

"Hmmm, how sad! Your little vision quest didn't pan out. But it seems he's still looking for you. I could give you so much more...this could be the beginning of something really exciting."

**Peregrine**

"Naughty, naughty. What a silly disguise for such a serious child. Don't they bore you, these dragon gods? Where's your sense of humor? They deserved it, all of them. Don't worry, I won't make you do something like that again...probably."

**Calcey**

"The little thief. Gold does not hold my attention...nevertheless I have many things I wish to take. Maybe you could take them for me. By the way..." (Calcey ages in reverse, the wrinkles on her face smoothing out like bedsheets being pulled taught, her back straightening. In the blink of an eye you see a young halfling woman, her shock of red hair gleaming in the light, her eyes wide in surprise). "...time is mine to control here. He has no power over you." (the vision vanishes, her back bending under the strain, the light of her hair fading to the shock of white).   

**Declan**

"Orphan among orphans. Does the weight of destiny never prove too heavy for you, o unsung chosen? I met one like you, once – son of arun, he had not your silver tongue, but a black stave." (Witchthorn looks confused at his own words here for a moment).

### Developments

If the PCs accept the pledge, Witchthorn reveals the following:

- The Zartruss clan are deadly archers, but worse still, they have completed a siege weapon. Control of this weapon could affect the outcome of the battle.
- The King's reflecting pool can transport the PCs directly into the stronghold, into an ancient Elven tower that the Zartruss have built around.
- The Cult of the Dragon do not merely seek Claugilyamatar's aid. They are trying to negotiate for a powerful artifact in her hoard: a Dragon Mask, an ancient relic with the power to make its wearer able to command dragons.

He allows them the use of his reflecting pool, a small pool of silver liquid at the base of a massive tree in the shady glade. The PCs can use the pool to be transported to a mirror in the basement of the ruins of the elven tower inside the stronghold.
