## Gathering Information

### Harpers

The HAWKs will attempt to find [Leosin Erlanthar](../Characters/Leosin%20Erlanthar.md) once arriving in Westbridge in order to bring his information back to Remi. He is conferring with Ontharr Frume on the field west of town the night they arrive, but if the PCs do not visit him, he will venture into town to seek them out and find a private place to talk.

Leosin has the following to reveal:

- He began suspecting a higher than normal amount of coordination between cult cells was occurring nearly a year ago when a harper spy was brutally assassinated in Greenest, and things appear to have only gotten worse since then.
- He sent Serge northward to the Moonsea in an attempt to discover the links between cells along the way. Meanwhile, he arranged to have himself captured by the cult in order to get inside information about their activities.
- While a captive, he learned that the movement to free Tiamat has grown rapidly in power. Many cultists speak of a new, charismatic leader who will return the cult to its former glory, perhaps even a descendant of Sammaster himself.
- This leader has assembled a group of powerful lieutenants known as *wyrmspeakers*, wearers of purple who claim the power to speak with and control dragons – sometimes called "dragon whisperers".
- Wearers of Purple from both the old and new cult are negotiating with Garbul, the hobgoblin warlord, in an attempt to gain Claugilyamatar's favor. The leader of the new cult faction, Alandra, seems to be interested in some item that Claugilyamatar keeps. It's unclear what Thalder, the leader of the old cult faction, wants
- Alandra's cultists deliver their wagons to the western gate of the fortress, near the hobgoblin's armory and siege workshop. Thalder's cultists use the eastern gate, nearby the section of wall that isn't yet completed. This intelligence was delivered by Harper spies posing as cultists, a tactic the PCs might consider.
- Leosin will accompany the main force, but his real purpose in being here is to look after the HAWKs on behalf of Remi. He has no intention of letting any of them – or himself – come to harm, and will flee if that appears likely.

Leosin wants to know the following:

- What has the cult been up to in the Moonsea region, its traditional stronghold? Leosin relies on Aya Glenmiir and other agents to bring him news, but hasn't traveled there in many years.
- What do the PCs plan to do at Kryptgarden? They can't hope to destroy the fortress on their own, but perhaps they can use the cover of the chaos created by the assault of the main force on the stronghold to remain undetected. It would be a huge loss if important intelligence was destroyed along with the fort.
- Since the main force will likely be slow due to its numbers, the PCs have the heavy burden of potentially arriving first. If that happens, they need to be stealthy.

### Emerald Enclave

The Enclave's druids and rangers are all encamped on the field west of town, in simple canvas tents and lean-tos close to the edge of the forest and away from the other groups. If the PCs ask around, they may find some wood elven archers and rangers, who will direct them to seek out the Dusk Circle, a small druidic sect from the southern part of Kryptgarden. The leader of the Dusk Circle is Shala Thaeral, an elf.

Shala has the following to reveal:

- The Dusk Circle has kept the nearby communities of Red Larch and Westbridge safe from the fey of Kryptgarden for centuries, since before Claugilyamatar established a lair here.
- King Witchthorn, a dark fey presence, has maintained a court in Kryptgarden since before humans settled the Sword Coast. He does not trouble the people of the nearby towns, so long as they do not trouble him. King Witchthorn is immensely powerful, more than even the strongest of wyrms, and his involvement could sway the tide of battle.
- From a combination of Claugilyamatar's evil presence and the Hobgoblins felling many trees, many of the forest creatures have either been killed or driven to madness. The signs of corruption are plain to read, manifesting as darkness and blight upon the land. If the evil continues to spread unchecked, it may take root permanently in Kryptgarden.
- It's unknown why King Witchthorn has allowed Claugilyamatar and her hobgoblin emissaries to roam freely in Kryptgarden, but the Circle's attempts to contact him have failed. The interior of the forest is treacherous, and King Witchthorn's glade appears to move about frequently. Shala shares where the Circle believes it currently resides.
- The Enclave will be leading the main force to the fortress, so if the PCs wish to venture to King Witchthorn's glade, they must do so alone.

Shala wants to know the following:

- There is a rumour among the forest folk than an ancient pact involving the citizens of the Moonsea and the Fey of the Quivering Forest was recently dissolved. Do the PCs know anything about this?
- How the PCs plan to destroy the fortress? If they set a fire, they must be exceedingly cautious, as it could spread rapidly and threaten the already beleaguered forest folk. The other delegations won't listen to the Enclave about this, but they may listen to the PCs.

### Order of the Gauntlet

The PCs can approach any of the Order's paladins, fighters, or clerics, who are easily identifiable by the prominent icons of a mailed fist, the sign of Torm, god of justice and law. They will direct the PCs to speak with Ontharr Frume, head of the order's Elturel chapter, who is encamped on the field to the west of town in the largest of the Order's splendid tents.

Ontharr has the following to reveal:

- The Order of the Gauntlet has heard rumors of red-robed wizards traveling through the Western heartlands, attempting to conceal their bald heads and tattoos with magic or disguises.
- One wizard was captured and brought to Elturel for magical interrogation by the Order, but turned himself into a pile of ash before he revealed any information. On his person, however, the Order found a map that appeared to depict some of the terrain inside Kryptgarden, including markings that highlighted a large hill some distance away from the fortress – perhaps a meeting location with the cult.
- If the PCs find any Red Wizards, the Order desires to recover their spellbooks. The Wizards use many schools of magic, but a necromancer would go a long way to proving that the Cult has secure outside help in their attempt to create dracoliches.
- Hobgoblins are calculating tacticians whose societies organize according to strict martial hierarchies, with a warlord at the top. Their fortresses tend to be crude but effective wooden structures, with palisade walls and watchtowers. Getting into the fortress will be tough, but the Order intends to look for any sections of the wall that remain incomplete and focus its efforts there.
- The Hobgoblin warlord, Garbul, will defend his clan's territory to the death. If the PCs sight him on the battlefield, they should under no circumstances engage him without aid, as he will be extremely dangerous. On the other hand, if the opportunity to eliminate him presents itself, this would be a huge blow to the clan's morale and organization.

Ontharr wants to know the following:

- It's rare for Red Wizards to be seen this far west. Have any appeared in the Moonsea region? That would seem more likely, if an alliance is indeed brewing.
- Will the PCs join the main assault on the fortress? The group will need all the help it can get, if it intends to destroy the fortress before Claugilyamatar intervenes. If not, perhaps they can investigate the location recovered from the wizard.

### Zhentarim

Staying at the other inn in town, the Hammer and Nail, are the Doom Raiders, a gang of adventurers who now work on behalf of the Zhentarim. Hearing that the Lord's Alliance delegation hadn't yet arrived, and seeing a business opportunity, they paid off the innkeeper and bought up all the rooms in order to resell them at triple the price. Renaer will complain about this to the PCs, as he was forced to cover the cost in order to save face in front of Al-Mandi.

If the PCs happen to confront the Doom Raiders, a brawl could result, but it would quickly be broken up by any member of the Order present, Al-Mandi, or even Leosin. If, instead, they seek information, the Doom Raiders can share what they know: that the hobgoblins have been assembling a siege weapon atop a tower at the southern end of their fortress. The Raiders plan to capture the weapon and use it to inflict as much chaos as possible when battle breaks out.

The Raiders have no intention of joining the main force, and instead plan to intercept one of the cult wagons and use that to gain entry to the stronghold. They will find one of the wagon-tracks through the forest outside of town and lie in wait, grabbing the first wagon that passes by them. If the PCs express interest in this plan, the Raiders share the location of the forest road (due southwest of Westbridge on an intersection course), but refuse to work together.

## Entering the Forest

No matter which way the PCs enter, the first encounter will be the Elven ruins and the Worgs (use the kg_wagons file). There are 8 worgs.
