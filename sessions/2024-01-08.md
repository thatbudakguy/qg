- a group of tattooed humans ride up and confront them, who turn out to be vaegould, warlike barbarians from this area.
- hagar tells the vaegould that the group are hunting a huge dragon, which seems to convince them that the gang is not to be trifled with. they ride off
- the gang arrives at verdigris, a rough-and-tumble mining town at the foothill of the dragonspine mountains. the varm tribe has encamped outside with its yurts, giant rams, and horses for trading.
- calcey helps the tribal elders prepare korkog, a traditional stew, with some premium meats and spices. hagar is welcomed and directed up the trail to the spring of voices, where headman ullo awaits.
- at the spring, the gang participate in a ritual using the kukka flowers that connects them to their ancestors. calcey is granted an audience with king witchthorn, while hagar is confronted with a violent vision where an orc shaman completes a bloody ritual involving the gatekeeper's crystal that kills him along with a very young half-orc girl, leaving a boy alive and alone, covered in blood.
