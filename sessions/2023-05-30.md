	- rooms full of couches, settees, etc. with easels and other art supplies around
	- rooms full of art, including fine pottery, paintings, etc. arranged in galleries. most everything of value has already been taken.
	- secret passages leading into and out of the bedrooms and chambers of various nobles, etc.
	- a banquet hall
	- billiard rooms, other large game rooms with chess tables, etc.
	- rooms themed according to foreign ideas, like a thay-themed room, elf-themed room, dwarf-themed room
	- bathhouse
- places where city watch, hawks, or soldiers have obviously been slaughtered by hangmen or xorack's forces
- on lower floors:
	- the sex dungeon/area, with a main "playroom" and adjoining small rooms for people to use in private
	- a store of weird toys, whips, chains, etc. (what do you see that disturbs you?)
	- many entrances and exits to the sewers, in totally unused areas
	- the primary entrance to xorack's lair, located in the orchestra pit of the theater:  an entire theater, with a dirty and mouldering stage, back rooms and dressing rooms, looks like it could seat a hundred people or more in two tiers
	- rooms where thugs are hanging out and eating, going thru items, shooting the shit, doing drugs.
	- troglodyte lairs
