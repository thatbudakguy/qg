## Bang
> You hold in your hand a somewhat hastily assembled piece of parchment bearing the signature of the Watcher Over the Hills, Erlan Duirsar, Lord of Evereska. A cohort of noble elves, gathered together at the Hall of the High Hunt, stare back at you in the fading light of the evening. Some are plainly afraid: just days ago a castle crashed into their secluded mountain realm, and now a vampire hunts in their midst, carrying off her victims in the dead of night. Others look at you with a mixture of apprehension and hope: the first non-Elven visitors to Evereska in a lifetime, foreigners who put the city in great danger and yet have promised to defend it from that same danger. Lord Duirsar speaks: "Though half of our Council has now departed for the Vine Vale, it is my right to grant you these emergency powers, and I do not hesitate to exercise it. I command you to set about forming your Task Force with all the speed you can muster. Here in Evereska we have made it our mission to depend only on ourselves, and I know some may question my decision in the days to come. But make no mistake: we are depending on you."

What do you do?
## Vine Vale
- Trueshot or Rhaellen Darthammel know that Tyrael didn't return from his patrol on the night of Ches 10.
- Captain Darthammel knows that Tyrael was a veteran of the Tomb Guard, not some fresh soldier. He was an expert ranger and, as a Cavewalker, knew the Passage better than most, as he was responsible for teaching it to the Elves who were preparing to leave the city.
- Both men know that no patrols entered Skyreach on the night of Ches 10, as it wasn't deemed safe. Tyrael's route would have taken him around the perimeter of the castle.
- It's difficult as the tracks are muddy and well-worn, but a PC can potentially retrace Tyrael's steps. A DC 20 Survival check reveals a scuffle took place some days ago on the far side of the castle, where a medium Creature struggled for some time. Blood was lost here, but oddly, only one pair of footprints leaves this area in a different direction.
- Araevin does not find Mithriel in the Vine Vale, and she won't respond to his _sending_ spells. He decides to try to visit her parents in the city on the off chance that she's with them and out of contact, but is deeply suspicious at this point.
## Floating Gardens
After the council session, when Thia returns to the Floating Gardens, she finds that Tyrael has already been there and taken away the two elves suffering from Marsh Fever. She immediately recognizes the gravity of the situation and sends for the Gang to come investigate when they are able.
- Thia is at the House of Cedars with some of the clergy when the Gang arrive.
- The two elves who have gone missing are Laethan and Morian, two hunters who had taken ill with Marsh Fever after hunting the in Vine Vale. They took ill on Ches 8, two days before Skyreach crashed, and were on the path to recovery but still in a weakened state.
- Ariandar Woodenhawk was the priest on duty when they were taken. He remembers admitting a soldier of the Vale Guard, tall and broad, who complained of fatigue and wished to drink from the spring. He admitted the soldier without question.
- Marsh Fever is uncommon, but can be contracted by contact with animal carcasses.
