# Scenes
## Eryn's Room
> Varick's body rests in the tiny, child-size wooden chair in the center of Eryn's room. The shouts and laughter of children outside echo eerily in the space, which has been covered with blood. Peregrine is breathing heavily.

what did Varick have on him?
- 

## Roarke House
- 
## Silmerhelve Villa
- Hallway with creepy portraits and magical mirrors.
- Dala greets them and thanks them for their audience w/ Council, and their dedication to the matter of the Draakhorn. Worried that their efforts will have been in vain. Council seems unable to take decisive action.
- "Lady Saerista" (Otaaryliakkarnos) is here, if pressed.
	- She uses _detect thoughts_ in a way that suggests she wants P to know she is using it.
	- What is on the surface of P's mind?
- Her questions for Peregrine ("what do you think about" vs. "what do you say"):
	- You were born and once lived in this city. Was your upbringing difficult? Why did you leave?
	- How did you come to the faith of the Platinum Dragon?
	- Are there crimes for which there is no forgiveness?
- If Peregrine yields and seems to be truthful, he gains the trust of the Metallic Dragons. Otaaryliakkarnos tells him the truth.
	- The Metallic Dragons are planning to assemble their own council, headed by Protanther, a Great Wyrm and King of Justice.
	- By tradition such a council should involve humanoid representatives. But, the Council of Waterdeep has not provided any representatives that appeal to the dragons yet â€“ and some are actively repellent (in particular, the elves and dwarves).
	- If P is willing, Otaaryliakkarnos will fly him to the sanctuary in the Nether Mountains where the dragons gather. It is a remote place inaccessible to most humanoids.
## Temple to Bahamut

## Scrying on Zora
> [!QUESTION] What's a notable physical feature she has?

She is at the old Foxteeth hideout under the pier, in front of a driftwood bonfire, sitting and sharpening a knife.
## Phlan
- the Thayan ship and its envoy were eventually recalled. They haven't heard anything since, but the blockade seems to still be active.
- The rumor is that Zhentil Keep is planning to leave the League after all.
## Nomad Village
> [!QUESTION] The village was always on the move, but you think you know where to find them. Where, and why do you know?

> The connection to the primal spirits, Ullo explains, predates even the arrival of the Eraka to the Ride. The oldest stories tell of a first age, where the people lived in a great forest that was warm and tangled, one filled with the energy that created the world, where trees grew to touch the sky. The primal spirits dwelt there, but a great cataclysm drove them from the forest, forcing the Eraka to flee and become nomads, forever wandering the realms. Since that time the spirits have spoken to their people only sporadically through the totems.

Legends that the Eraka know about Myth Ondath:

### Hagar's Playmate

## A Dream
