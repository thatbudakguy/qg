# Outline
## Bang
- dome goes away, araevin tries to question mithriel.

## College of Magic
A dragon got up here, and it started to assault the academy, but it stayed too long and was destroyed by the Mythal's power when it reactivated. There might be some recoverable Dragon parts here.
## Vine Vale
Heavy damage to the tent city, but overall not a huge number of people died. Battle was mostly for control of Skyreach; when the soldiers realized that the dragons were coming for that, they sort of pulled back. Dragonfire melted a hole into the iceberg and the dragons made off with what they could fit into the sack, and melted some other stuff, but some treasure was left.

People here can tell about what they witnessed of the raiding party, including a Dwarf astride Glazhael who was wearing a white dragon mask.
## Hall of the High Hunt
Duirsar calls a council of the Hill Elders.
- Trueshot reports on the losses in the vine vale and what happened
- Alyn reports on the attack on the College of Magic
- Araevin reports on the battle in the Groaning Cave, including the *soultheft* that Mithriel cast. He also says that the Black Dragon Mask needs to be moved, as the Cult now know where it is.
