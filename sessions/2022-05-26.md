![a3e12](../logbook/act-iii/a3e12.md)
# Outline
## Questions
- What is the Cult's next move?
- What should become of Mithriel?
- Where will the Gang go next?
- What should be done with the *Black Dragon Mask*?
## Bang
- dome goes away.

## College of Magic
A dragon got up here, and it started to assault the academy, but it left after the Mythal reactivated. Alyn led the students into the Conservatory to shelter, and he can describe the Dragon suddenly leaving when the Mythal came back up.
## Vine Vale
> description\

- Heavy damage to the tent city, but overall not a huge number of people died.
- Battle was mostly for control of Skyreach; when the soldiers realized that the dragons were coming for that, they sort of pulled back.
- 
- Dragonfire melted a hole into the iceberg and the dragons made off with what they could fit into the sack, and melted some other stuff, but some treasure was left.
- People here can tell about what they witnessed of the raiding party, including a Dwarf astride the White dragon who was wearing purple robes and a strange white mask.
## Hall of the High Hunt
Duirsar calls a council of the Hill Elders.
- Trueshot reports on the losses in the vine vale and what happened
- Alyn reports on the attack on the College of Magic
- Araevin reports on the battle in the Groaning Cave, including the *soultheft* that Mithriel cast. He also wonders whether the Black Dragon Mask needs to be moved, as the Cult now know where it is. Araevin's idea is to cast *nondetection* on the Gang and have them move it to a safe place, if they know of one. The mask itself could be scryed on, but if it's in a dark and hidden location, this wouldn't reveal anything useful. They would have 8 hours to move the item before the spell deactivates.
