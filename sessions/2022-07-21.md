# Outline
## Bang
> Araevin slowly closes the large, leather-bound volume he had been deeply engrossed with.  "I think this book may have been some of Denlor's notes on genie-binding...but we certainly aren't the target audience. That said, it's a place to start. Have a look." He hands the book to Declan.
## Phlan
### Denlor's Tower
- Araevin found a partially-completed work that Denlor had been intending to use with his best students to talk about djinni sigils for binding, but perhaps abandoned.
- The book is written in Denlor's own shorthand and intended to lecture with, so it's pretty obtuse. Some of it is also written in Halruaan (which, like Loross and Netherese, is written in draconic script)
- The magical shorthand that isn't in Halruaan describes inscribing the sigils into rare magical objects (e.g. gems or wands), attuning to the object, and then being able to cast spells to bend the djinni's will with massively increased power.
- The crux of it is knowing how to generate the sigil. Djinni have extremely long and complex names, but you only need to use one name (not an abbreviated form) in order for the benefit to take effect. On non-djinni, however, the sigils are harmless and have no power.
- Included are several demonstration sigils. One is obviously a sigil derived from Denlor's own name. The other two are the names of Gensor and Ranthor, but the context for this is absent.
- Araevin tricks Ali into showing him the Sigil for his own name by claiming to have figured it out and intentionally supplying a false one (winking at the gang as he does).
- Araevin thinks if they can get at least one of Ali's real names, and inscribe it, they can command him to let them access Denlor's personal chambers.
