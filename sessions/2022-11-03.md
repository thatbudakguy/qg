The gang have a few days (if needed) before departure.

## Departing Waterdeep
- when the gang are ready, Ren takes them down to the Dock Ward to get introduced to captain Klaus "Half-face" Bergmann.
- Klaus is a tall, fair-haired Illuskan man who keeps his face hidden at all times under a large leather hood, because it's been eaten away by frostbite. He left a family of miners in Luskan and decided to be the first man to map the Sea of Moving Ice â€” or as much of its patterns as could be mapped. He calls his ship his "wife".
- His crew are from all over Faerun, including some obviously from far-off lands to the South, and even one or two half-orc and dwarven sailors.
-  _Frostskimmr_ is a sixty-foot-long longship with a single deck and limited cargo space in its hold. It has no structures on deck, but the crew rig sailcloth shelters to keep out the cold.
- Its design keeps it fast and nimble, and light enough to be hauled by its crew of thirty across the ice if necessary.

> [!QUESTION] As _Frostskimmr_ leaves the harbor, what are you thinking about?
