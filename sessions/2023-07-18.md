# Scenes
## Opening
> The air is thick with tension in the stacks of the library of the Tower of Arcane Might, and all other patrons have surreptitiously exited the floor. You are staring down the wands of four Cloaks of Mulmaster, led by a tall and burly man with skin the color of red wine and two black curling ram's horns sprouting from his bald head. His yellowed eyes are fixed on you as he speaks in an angry baritone. "Impersonating a member of the Cloaks is a crime punishable by death. I'll give you one chance to explain your presence here before I haul you in front of a magistrate. Lie to me, and I'll carry out your execution myself." What do you do?

The Wands (so named because they carry a _wand of the war mage +1_)
- Titus (Towerwarden, carries a +2 wand)
- Alfons (young and cruel with long dark hair, flashing eyes â€” malfoy esque)
- Brigitte (blonde buzz cut, glasses, prim but merciful)
- Gorku (female punky orc with a bunch of piercings, chaotic)

(+1, ignore half cover)

## Labs
### Moments/GM Moves
- a wrenching scream echoes through the halls
- strange, elongated bloodstains on the floor
- a window to the outside showing sunset, which actually proves to be on the other side of a blank wall

### Gensor's Lab
> PTS: how do you know that this is a place where any experiments are tolerated/encouraged

impossibly huge, oddly empty warehouse-like space with slabs of dark stone broken up into huge tiles. lights flicker to life, showing the scale model of the weapon on a rotating platform in the center. 15 feet up in the air, salvar is slowly rotating, frozen in a mask of fear, in a strange soap bubble

iron tiger is waiting, invisible, here. but he flickers. from afar, like the wizard of oz, gensor makes his offer.

voice: low, gravelly, slightly accented. european ish

- eryn made a poor apprentice, but she makes an excellent scrying focus.
- when he attempted to repurpose her, you killed his protege/link to the cult of the dragon, and stole two apprentices at once

["old maid" from it follows soundtrack]

- i arrived at king's pyre too late to stop you, but you left something behind that would become one of my greatest treasures. the wreck of a man bent on revenge, whose soul was as hard as iron. i made him into a tiger. my iron tiger.
