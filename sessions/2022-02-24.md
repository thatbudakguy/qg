# Outline
## Bang
> As the balcony of ice breaks away from the mass of the tower, a shower of white explodes into the air, punctuated by the shouting of the soldiers below. You see the wide-eyed face of Tomb Master Colbathin as his grip on the balcony fails, realizing that he is about to take a fall he may not survive. Roll initiative!

[Kinyon](../../npcs/kinyon-colbathin.md)'s fall is 75 feet, and it will take only one round. If he hits the ground, he will take 7d6 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone, likely also breaking a leg.

Characters who wish to help Kinyon but fail could Push their roll (taking a point of Exhaustion), or be offered a Devil's Bargain (perhaps a treasured item falls in the fracas and is destroyed) in exchange for the chance to reroll.
