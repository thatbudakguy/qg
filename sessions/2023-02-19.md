# Scenes
## At Sea
> Having left in the early afternoon and proceeded for the remainder of the day and all night, the _Seagull's Caw_ has traveled about 60 miles of her 150 mile journey. The sun rises on the Moonsea, bringing a brief respite from the rain. In the morning light, the faint outlines of other ships can occasionally be seen far off on the horizon.
### Stats
16 STR (+3)
8 DEX (-1)
14 CON (+2)
### Components
Hull: AC 15, 150 HP
Helm: AC 16, 25 HP. If destroyed, can't turn.
Oars: AC 12, 50 HP. 1mph speed when active. Damage can reduce to zero speed.
Sail: AC 12, 50 HP. 3mph speed when active with good wind. Damage can reduce to zero speed.
### Travel
The _Seagull's Caw_ travels about 3mph with favorable winds, or 1mph under oar power. She can travel about 75 miles in a day (actually 72).

The ship can take one of two routes to get to Mulmaster:
- Hugging the coast, which decreases the chance that one will encounter Moonsea League blockade ships, but is a longer journey (230 miles; about three days)
- Going directly, which is a shorter journey but carries an increased chance of running into potentially hostile ships (150 miles; about two days)

Some interaction with the blockade is almost guaranteed.

### Crew
While the Gang are aboard, the crew yield any desired positions to whoever in the Gang wants to assume that position.

- Arvin and Harumbr Copperpot, the two dwarves, are native Phlanites of the Copperpot clan, who once mined the Dragonspines but whose numbers have dwindled over the centuries. Quarrel with each other and everyone else. Tell each other to shut up constantly. Scottish. Call each other "Arv" and "Har". QUARTERMASTER
- Dent, 40s, originally a carpenter and roofer from Phlan. Missing most of his teeth. Will generally go with whatever his compatriots decide. Speaks toothlessly. "I might be missin somethin...." BOSUN
- Ilham, 30s, former mercenary from Hillsfar. Short, military-style haircut and gold tooth. Shrewd and calculating. Likes hazing Calvin. Gravelly "hey kid" voice, says "ain't". FIRST MATE
- Pike Coldroot, 40s, former soap merchant recruited from Zhentil Keep. Slight paunch, receding hairline. Fled Zhent retribution for not paying his protection money. Dotes on Calvin. Hesitant voice, wrings hands. SURGEON, COOK
- Calvin Bramblebottom, 16, the shy son of Old Man Bramblebottom who brews cider in Kabel's Hill. Just a kind farm boy. Strawberry blonde hair, tall and awkward. Talks and thinks very slowly/considered, "grandad would say...". CAPTAIN
### Events at Sea
Roll twice per day (day, night) while the ship is at sea. If a specific result has already happened, you can choose to roll again. If hugging the coast, you can re-roll a 1 or 2 but must keep the new result.
