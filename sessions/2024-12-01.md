# Recap
- returned to Denlor's Tower to free Ali to fight alongside you (Peregrine still playing him)
- assaulted the Well and engaged Nagamat in battle, eventually bringing him low enough to destroy his phylactery
- once mainline Cult infantry and Wearers of Purple were routed, much of the cult mercenary force fled
- Dwarves of the North and their king, Connerad, fell in battle but gained a strategic advantage
- Protanther, great Wyrm and King of Justice, and many of Faerun's good-aligned dragons fell to their Chromatic brethren
- Magnar was summoned and singlehandedly engaged the Chromatic dragons, driving them from the field

# Intro
The battle raged all day and into the night. Ragged smoke and mist move over the war-torn battlefields around the Well, where fallen warriors lie for miles around in the dust. A full moon, gigantic and strangely red-tinted, has risen, illuminating the carnage. It is nearly at its zenith over the Well. There is no time to gather your remaining forces or even to lick your wounds: the ritual is nearly complete!

As the ground slopes upwards towards the massive caldera of the well, nearly a mile across, Ali says "Worms, do not step forward. I sense strange magic". Barely visible is the mythal, still active as a shimmering dome like smoked glass that glints in the light. Just beyond is the gaping entrance to a lava tube that burrows deep into the side of the crater, out of sight.

# Outside the Well

## Mythal
- smoked glass **dome** over a mile wide, strange oily-black appearance, everything on the other side appears shadowy and indistinct
- **threads of magic that are darkened**, leading not to the weave but away from this plane, to somewhere else, like an overlaid fabric
- individual threads propping up the dome, nearly 100 of them, but as they go inwards they become indistinct and smoky

### Info
- the GKC can't be used outright to alter this mythal because it wasn't created using the weave, but if you enter it using a portal, you could
- the effects of the mythal will immediately kill any non-dragons who enter without pledging loyalty to tiamat. but the work seems...hasty?
- soultheft was used to raise this mythal, but **the souls being used** haven't been consumed yet. there's still somewhere...wherever the threads lead. but they may not last.
- two noticeable **loopholes**: there's a backdoor for "contractors" (i.e. the mages) and also **dragonkin** can enter, even if polymorphed

## Karsus's World
- **ground of crushed black glass**, strange and horrible **spires** like buildings made of crumbling sheets of it, boulders scattered about
- giant, dim red sun hanging lazily in the sky
- tall, gaunt purple-skinned creatures wielding huge hammers with mouths in the center of their bodies
- **cube of smoked glass** on a plateau surrounded by guard thaluuds, where a huge crowd of shabbily-dressed people has gathered, some laying on the ground motionless, others pacing about
- black, twisting threads of magic leaving the cube and spinning out into the air lazily

### Info
- no normal magic works here, but you can cast spells just by thinking them, although doing so gains you the immediate attention of the thaluuds
- battling thaluuds is 2d6+STAT depending on how you choose to do it; just rotate through gang, but they will appear more or less infinitely
- if they simply opt to end the mythal, the souls of the captives will be abandoned here.
- on a 10+, the souls of the imprisoned could even be freed and returned to their bodies in the Well, creating a small army (albeit of mostly unarmed commoners) who could overwhelm the remaining forces at the well.

### The Captives
- commoners taken from the surrounding towns, mostly in the raid on the caravan city, Scornubel. been at the well for weeks surviving on a starvation diet
- strange foreigners in huge black cloaks were brought in and shown them, looked at their hair, teeth, eyes, etc. to judge their bodies??
- after digging their own grave, blasted with dark magic, but appeared here instead of dying, where the black-cloaks were waiting and herded them into this cube. cloaks could somehow order the thaluuds.
- Vil, a male human former cleric of Lathander (nominal **leader**) "By dawn's light...I prayed to the Morninglord to send a champion to free us from the dragons...but it was not he who heard my prayers. Hail, champion of Bahamut. Kneel!" asks for everyone to be set free
- Talya, a tiefling flautist and dancer, whose wife Valeria led the revolt in which six were killed. as a result of this, some died without contributing to the mythal, shortening its "lifespan". Asks for people to be returned to the material plane so she can bury her wife.
- After the revolt, Severin ordered them prematurely killed so that they couldn't escape and their souls could be used.
- names: Tamond, Haddeus, Leodor, Lachira

## Lava Tube

Leads into the well, to the **Prisoner Pens**.

# Inside the Well

## Prisoner Pens
- slain bodies of prisoners used to erect the Mythal, who were pushed into a shallow mass grave with no visible wounds
- path that leads to **hallway** that arcs around the central chamber
- in the hallway, six older bodies haphazardly pushed into a corner with obvious burns and stab wounds, signs of **a struggle from the revolt**, including a half-orc with a lance through her chest (Valeria)

## Hallway
- curves around the edge, with occasional **windows** opening into the central caldera, ranging in size from a fist to a house
- occasionally, small **lava tubes** that lead away from the center and upwards, back outside
- one very large **path away from the center** that shows heavy sled tracks dragged into the ground and huge footprints, as well as a few scattered coins (to the treasure chamber)
- gradually rises up until it meets the **draakhorn chamber**, with small tracks as of a wheeled object going up

## Treasure Chamber
> You see goldâ€”mountains of it. And jewels... and pearls... silver plate and gilded mirrors... jeweled swords and the armor of kings... caskets and boxes and barrels filled to overflowing with the treasure of the Sword Coast, packed into a cave the size of a cathedral and stacked to the height of a giant! Pathways wind through a glittering mass whose reflected light dazzles your eyes, like a million twinkling stars close enough to touch.

## Draakhorn Chamber
- raised up about 50ft, has a view into the central caldera into which the horn is pointed
- was being blown by an elemental, but it left. takes two people to operate otherwise...ordinarily
- anyone who enters its cone or starts its turn there when being blown has to make DC 15 CON save; take 6d8 thunder damage and is prone, save for half & not prone.

## Central Caldera
- size and shape of a football stadium. floor slopes gently down to the center; curves back up to a "roof" with a central circular aperture hundreds of feet across
- uneven **floor littered with dragon bones**, femurs the size of trees, teeth, scales. about 100ft away is an **open pit of bones** that sinks into the floor.
- breathtaking 100ft-tall **temple of tiamat** in center made of volcanic ash fused with bones, all chaotic angles and jutting buttresses, with people milling about.
- **lava tube entrances** scattered around the perimeter
- at the opposite end, high up in the wall, is a gallery facing in where **a massive horn** the size of a car is mounted in a wooden turret, sitting silently.

### Sinkhole
- drops 30 ft into a pit of sharp bones; difficult terrain

### Tiamat's Temple
- cathedral-like, open structure
- five chapels on "ground floor", one for each dragon type, with landings 50ft up
- central spire with sanctuary atop it, landing 100ft up
- several **spellcasters wearing large black cloaks** with huge hoods are standing in each of the chapels, while about 10 more of them stand around the temple.
- at the top of the central spire, a **man in a fantastic gilt-edged red cloak** is levitating gently, legs crossed, wearing a huge mask with multicolored dragon embellishments.
- a gaunt **skeleton-like man** wielding a huge longsword stands motionless looking up at the man levitating at the top of the temple.
- in the void in the central spire, a **gaping oval-shaped portal** 50 ft tall with jagged edges has opened, depicting the fires of Avernus

#### Insights
- the shadowcaster in the black chapel is having trouble coaxing energy out of the ground; his stream seems "weaker"
- the mask worn by the man at the very top looks like the dragon masks, but larger, fiercer, and multicolored
- the mask itself is tied into the ritual; removing it would break the connection
- each of the streams seems about halfway to completion, except the black one
- the gaunt man in the tattered cloak with the sword is not alive

#### The Ritual
- as long as the _mask of the dragon queen_ is physically in the caldera, the ritual can continue. without it, everything would come crashing down.
- if a spellcaster is concentrating on channeling energy at one of the chapels, that pulls the aspect of tiamat across the planes through the portal.
- ten rounds of energy required to bring each aspect of tiamat through. four rounds of energy have already been channeled for each aspect except black, which only has one.
- using the GKC??

### Enemies
- severin: raspy, rasputin-esque voice
- naergoth: doesn't speak, just exhales zombie sounds
- mages: arabic-sounding exclamations: mak hut tab! a'sshamai lab! sa wat dee!
