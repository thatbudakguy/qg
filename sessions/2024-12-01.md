# todo
- inside the Well

# recap
- returned to Denlor's Tower to free Ali to fight alongside you (Peregrine still playing him)
- assaulted the Well and engaged Nagamat in battle, eventually bringing him low enough to destroy his phylactery
- once mainline Cult infantry and Wearers of Purple were routed, much of the cult mercenary force fled
- Dwarves of the North and their king, Connerad, fell in battle but gained a strategic advantage
- Protanther, great Wyrm and King of Justice, and many of Faerun's good-aligned dragons fell to their Chromatic brethren
- Magnar was summoned and singlehandedly engaged the Chromatic dragons, driving them from the field

# intro
The battle raged all day and into the night. Ragged smoke and mist move over the war-torn battlefields around the Well, where fallen warriors lie for miles around in the dust. A full moon, gigantic and strangely red-tinted, has risen, illuminating the carnage. It is nearly at its zenith over the Well. There is no time to gather your remaining forces or even to lick your wounds: the ritual is nearly complete!

As the ground slopes upwards towards the massive caldera of the well, nearly a mile across, Declan holds out a hand and calls for you to stop. Visible in his spellsight is the mythal, still active as a shimmering dome like smoked glass that glints in the light.

# outside the well
the mythal was created using the souls of 50 (100?) captives. to re-key it, you will have to use the GKC and also confront them. free them? they are afraid. but they could also help?

- mythal was created using soultheft, and also The Hand Behind The Mirror used the Shadow Weave to create it, so it's sort of...different.
- Instead of the souls of the slain being used, they are effectively imprisoned in a pocket dimension and their life force slowly siphoned in order to keep the mythal working, since it was only ever intended to be temporary while Tiamat's Temple was being erected
- they were going to revolt anyway, but Severin ordered them prematurely killed so that they couldn't escape and their souls could be used. as a result of this, some died without contributing to the mythal, shortening its "lifespan".
- **who was the 'rebel' leader?**
- on a 10+, the souls of the imprisoned could even be freed and returned to their bodies in the Well, creating a small army (albeit of mostly unarmed commoners) who could overwhelm the remaining forces at the well.
- if they simply opt to end the mythal, the souls of the captives will be abandoned here.

# inside the well
this should feel like a race against time to get into the caldera
inside the well: Tiamat’s temple, the Hand Behind The Mirror, Severin, Naergoth, and the nearly complete mask of the dragon queen

TODO: print severin and naergoth stats?

# tiamat's return
Tiamat partially emerges, but you can use the GKC to send her back…at a cost.
