- one nilshai and two ethereal marauders
- four nilshai
- a herd of giant dragonflies
- abandoned star elf citadel, its walls pitted and scarred as if from acid
- blight-stricken forest that cross the path
- blight-stricken animals
- fey?? witchthorn?
- menhir with Sylvan writing, so faded it's just a few letters (but recognizably Sylvan), with Elvish atop it

# The Sunglade

- exterior?
- archcantor and cantors?
- the chorus?

it takes 6 hours (one encounter roll) to reach here from citadel Deirr.

## Ways to notice the old Sunglade usage

- things written in Sylvan on Menhirs or elsewhere
- friendly Fey? more Fey?
- blight, and Fey talking about the blight

## The Sunglade

- the one hundred members of the Chorus (there are always 100) are here
- the Archcantor and five Cantors are here guiding them in the Song
- two concentric circles of 20-ft Menhirs with a gargantuan tree that seems to distort perspective in the center
- the roots are huge, and seems to encircle some massive object, winding deep into the mossy ground

When they arrive, Nesterin will announce them
