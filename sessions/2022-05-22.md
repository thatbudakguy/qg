# Outline
## Bang
> [!NOTE] Start "Treachery" here.

> The sentry's words hang in the air: "Intruders approaching from the Greycloak hills. Sir...it's three dragons." Araevin turns to the commander immediately. "Trueshot, they're coming for Skyreach Castle, but the Mythal will hold, it has to. The castle is inside the Meadow Wall. They don't know this is a suicide mission, the magic is strong enough to kill even adult dragons given enough time—" But commander Colbathin cuts him off. "Withdraw all sentries from the castle and the passage and order all lights and cookfires to be extinguished. And by Corellon, get me more wands! Every mage in the city! All of you —" he looks each one of you in the eyes — "you saved my life on board that castle when the vampire spawn attacked. Now...save my soldiers."

What do you do?
## Meadow Wall
PCs have time to decide what to do, and to order Trueshot and his men around if they feel like. Depending on orders the PCs give, you can assess modifiers to the clock that will track the status of the battle.

Once they make their decision and step outside the tent, both Araevin and Declan make perception checks. If Declan doesn't notice, Araevin does.
> "Something's wrong...the mythal. Impossible! The ritual that created that spell took the lives of three of the greatest high mages of Elvenkind. It cannot be altered by any less than three wielders of High Magic, and I am the only...Mithriel! We have to find my student!"

Araevin sets off for the Groaning Cave and will plead for the PCs to accompany him if they do not do so immediately. When the PCs leave to head to the Passage, they see the Dragons attack the Vine Vale just as they are approaching the entrance.
> Barely a mile away, dragonfire lights up the night as the raiding party descends on Skyreach. Fierce shouts and screams echo into the night, and huge dark shapes wheel around the wreck of the castle as arrows and spellfire blast up into the sky. 

The raiding party includes the dragons Vorgansharax (adult green), Lennithon (adult blue), and Glazhael (adult white), along with ten Dragonwings, a Half-dragon Veteran, two Dragonsoul bodyguards, and Varram the White aboard four Wyverns. Their mission is to recapture the treasure from Skyreach, and for this purpose the dragons carry with them a huge canvas sack, unaware that the treasure is largely inaccessible and the Dragon Mask is not there.

> [!NOTE] Start the battle clock and explain its mechanism here.

During the battle, the cult will be simultaneously attempting to recapture the treasure from Skyreach Castle in the Vine Vale.
	- on initiative count 20, roll a d6.
	- on a 1-3, tick one segment on the skyreach battle clock (6 segments).
	- on a 4 or 5, do nothing.
	- on a 6, remove one segment from the clock.

## Groaning Cave
### Anteroom
The passage leading to the cave narrows to a 5ft width, necessitating the PCs entering in single-file. Araevin casts *mage armor* and *stoneskin* on himself (resistance to physical damage) before entering, withdrawing diamond dust from his spell pouch and muttering in Elvish as his flesh becomes alabaster white. He also casts *mind blank* on himself. At this point, he also realizes that to re-enable the Mythal, they will need a third caster, presuming Mithriel even still lives. He uses this moment to inform Declan of his suspicions about Declan's origins.

> [!NOTE] Play "Araevin's Theme" here.

> Declan...wait for a moment. Evereska's Mythal is a ritual of complement. That means we have no hope of reactivating it without three wielders of Elven high magic. If my suspicions are correct, we may need to free Mithriel from a compulsion she is under, but that still leaves only two. But this is not all I suspect. One does not spend fifty years being engaged to marry a woman without learning to recognize her distinctive traits in another. I am as certain as I have ever been that you were born of Ilsevele Miratar, the last Coronal of the city of Myth Drannor, and the woman who left me. There is royal blood in you, and something else besides, which granted you your spellsight. Your mind may not know the magic, but your heart does, so listen. Inside the mythal chamber there is a great book that rests on a pedestal, containing the souls of the High Mages who gave their lives to cast the spell. If you draw close to it, you can reach out with your mind and speak with them, as I once did. Know that this is immensely dangerous. It carries a risk of death...not of the body, but of the mind. You are not my student, and I would never ask this in any other situation, but I believe we have no choice. The rest of you...mark my words. Tonight, we are not vampire hunters. We are here to deliver on our promise to commander Colbathin and to save the lives of those soldiers. Protect us as we try to reactivate the city's magic. Then...we hunt vampire. Together.

> [!NOTE] Ask for a marching order here and start "Out of Time".

Sandesyl has had time to set some traps for the PCs to slow down their entry into the Cave, including an "early warning system" that triggers the arrival of her Children of the Night. Sandesyl ordered Mithriel to cast a *Glyph of Warding* on the floor right after the exit from the entrance tunnel into the Anteroom, at a radius that will affect the first 4 PCs in the marching order (20ft). The Glyph is set as [explosive runes](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Glyph%20of%20Warding#content), which will deal 5d8 fire damage on a successful DC 14 dex save or half as much on a success. When the Glyph is either triggered or disabled, Sandesyl activates her *Children of the Night* feature to call 2d4 swarms of Bats to the Anteroom, which arrive in 1d4 rounds. Araevin casts *fire shield* on himself to defend against the bats.

### Entrance
After the bat battle, Araevin activates the door to the Mythal room ("stand back!").

> [!NOTE] Pause music here and use the Cutscene mode to show Araevin opening the door.

> A huge cave glitters in the light of unearthly crystals and arcane sigils carved into the rock, bounded on three sides by massive carvings of ancient Elven mages, easily a hundred feet tall, their stern faces staring down to the earth floor. A rock outcropping nearly fifteen feet tall rises from the center of the cavern, studded with bioluminescent crystals and pulsating with arcane energy. Floating above it in the air is a boulder the size of a horse-drawn wagon covered in arcane glyphs and overgrown foliage that drips to the platform below, where an ancient-looking book rests on a pedestal, its pages opened. At the foot of the pedestal, dimly visible, are what look like two desiccated corpses. Kneeling next to them is the form of Mithriel Summergale, transfixed by her own two hands, apparently unable to say anything other than a panicked "I....I...I..."

When the PCs figure out what's happening, Sandesyl's voice echoes through the cavern: "Too late! Too late!"
> [!NOTE] Roll initiative! and start "Mythal Battle" music here.
### Battle
#### Environment
The book on the pedestal controls the spell that maintains the Mythal, and has been deactivated by Mithriel's ritual. Anyone can use a standard action to make a DC 24 Arcana check within 10 feet of the book to attempt to manipulate the Mythal. On a success, the caster commands the spirit of one of the three mages who created the Mythal, until they move more than 10 feet away from the book or use a bonus action to cease interacting with the Mythal. If three casters simultaneously succeed in this way, the Mythal can be altered, disabled, or enabled. On a failure, the caster suffers 3d10 psychic damage. 

#### Goals & Tactics
**Sandesyl**
- Charm the members of the party starting with the lowest Wisdom score (Hagar or Calcey, then Declan, then Peregrine).
- Ask whoever is charmed first where the Mask is, then relay this information to the Cult. Then turn the party against each other.
- Stay out of combat unless people are using spells from range, then go for them.

**Tyrael**
- Tie up the strongest-looking member of the party in physical combat and drain health.
- Kill Mithriel if she is no longer charmed.
- Attack anyone who comes near the Mythal book.
- If convinced that he is under the spell of Sandesyl (DC 17 persuasion check base), charm effect ends

**Mithriel**
- Casts *greater invisibility* initially, then *misty step*, *shield*, *fly*, etc. to move away from party members unless freed from Charm (DC 17 persuasion check base)
- Tries to *counterspell* any spells the Party casts unless freed from Charm
- Tries to reactive the Mythal once freed from Charm
- Vents her rage using *fireball* or *ice storm* on Sandesyl after Mythal is reactivated?

**Araevin**
- Tries to *counterspell* any spells that Mithriel casts.
- Tries to free Mithriel from her charm by reminding her that he "rescued" her from her parents, who did not recognize her talents.
- Once Mithriel is freed and all three casters are able to reach the book, casts *Wall of Force* around them while they interact with the Mythal. This effectively imprisons them for the rest of combat.

## Conclusion
> [!NOTE] Play "Hunter's Requiem" when combat ends.
- Tell folks they can level up when the encounter ends.
- If Mithriel lives, she breaks down crying when out of combat. Araevin, furious, shakes her screaming "Who taught you this magic?!"
