# Outline
## Bang
> As the sun rises above the horizon, you wander downstairs at the Unicorn and Crescent looking for some water to drink and whatever food might be left in the communal kitchen from the debauchery of the previous night. Who wakes up first and what do they see when you they get down to the common room?
## Truth or Consequences
### The Duel
Trueshot arrives with an audience of several of the Cold Hand soldiers who wanted to witness the duel, unless anyone objects.

**Trueshot asks if Hagar wants to wear armor, or to strip down for the fight.** He notes that none of the Elves will find the nakedness disturbing, but is happy to accommodate whatever the party is comfortable with. "The Dwarves are right about one thing — courage is the best armor". If Hagar does decide to duel naked, have him describe how he looks to everyone. The assembled soldiers applaud this choice.

Trueshot's AC is 19, but it's 11 without armor.

> "We'll do this just like the cadets at the College of Arms. No weapons, and no hits with intent to kill — strictly non-lethal. If you've taken more than half of what you can handle, the fight is over — nobody walks away from this bloodied. And no one other than the duelists gets involved. That work with you?"
#### Tactics
Trueshot has 110 HP and fights until reduced to 55 HP (bloodied).

While he has significant HP, Trueshot will attempt to shove (one attack action, contested check as grapple) Hagar prone. On a success, he then attempts to grapple to keep Hagar from standing up. Attacks against a prone character have advantage, and attacks from that character have disadvantage.

Trueshot activates his *second wind* as a bonus action to regain 10hp at a critical moment during the fight.
### The Wedding
Elisia Evenwind comes back to confirm that Declan is ready to take her hand in marriage. She starts out by confirming that he remembers everything last night, including when he said she was the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen.

The Evenwind family has kept a special diadem for generations, but the diadem is consecrated to Hanali Celanil, the Elven goddess of love. Elisia's mother Elphara believes that if her daughter is not shortly married, the goddess will be angered by the family's lack of devotion to love.

**How does Declan want to handle this situation?** If Declan is honest and forthright about the fact that he does not love Elisia, she will be downcast but understanding: it is better not to lie in the face of the gods. Her family will understand.
## The Mask
Araevin's research into the *sequester* spell reveals that its required components are very specific, and unfortunately not quite what he has on hand. The spell requires four specific gems — diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire — ground into dust, with a total value of at least 5,000gp.  The total value of spell components he has on hand would only be about 1,000gp, but if the gang can acquire the remaining components, he is willing to attempt to cast the spell on a *dragon mask*.

In the meantime, Araevin recommends casting *nondetection* to give the party 8 hours to move the mask to someplace safe and dark, like Denlor's Tower, and then ward the area if desired.
## Denlor's Tower
### Returning home
When the party returns to Denlor's Tower, Ali immediately verbally assaults them, wanting to know where they have been and what they are up to now. He wonders aloud whether the unfamiliar face who has suddenly appeared with them should be killed (i.e. if he should "turn up the heat"). Araevin, for his part, is fascinated by the Efreet, having only heard stories of these fire-genies.
### Securing the Tower
For securing the tower, Araevin has prepared these spells. He notes that power has an inverse relationship to time; the more permanent spells are less powerful:
- *arcane lock* (lv2, until dispelled)
- *glyph of warding* (lv3, until dispelled, explosion or spell)
- *mordenkainen's private sanctum* (lv4, up to 100ft cube, can block divination, travel, sight, all, etc. for 24hrs)
- *guards and wards* (lv6, complex, affects whole tower, 24hrs)
## Aya Glenmiir
Aya has noticed the Lord Sage looking over his shoulder frequently when the two meet, and he seems to be less willing to leave Mantor's Library to join her for lunch or venture out into town. She suspects that he is afraid that someone is watching him. If pressed, she is able to recall one night quite a long time ago — maybe 50 years — where he was a little deep in his cups and spoke darkly as though someone still lived in the world who would wish him harm. She never did get him to admit to this later or provide any details.

Aya's last student, the noble Devon Nanther of Melvaunt, has withdrawn from her studies as of a tenday ago, apparently at the behest of his family. Aya thinks the Nanthers are preparing for war.

## The Lord Sage
If approached before Aya he denies that anything is wrong
Insight could catch that he's still hiding something
