# Outline
## Bang
> You wake to the sounds of quiet conversation in Elvish from the common room below, and the smell of someone cooking something delicious in the kitchen. Rays of early spring sun filter in through the ancient leaded glass windows of the inn. Your host Mithriel is nowhere to be found. What do you do?
## Buy, sell, trade
### General goods
Some very dusty supplies are in the basement of the [unicorn-and-crescent-inn](../locations/evereska/unicorn-and-crescent-inn.md) for this purpose, although they may be so old as to not function (but they're free)! For everything else adventuring, you'd need to leave town, most likely. Mithriel could provide a tour, but she's not around...
### Weapons & Armor
#### Selling
PCs can sell some objects to the School of Arms, where the Quartermaster may keep them as training pieces for those who enlist in the Vale Guard or Tomb Guard.
#### Buying
There's one shop in town run by a collector named Serode, a female Elf who goes by only her first name and is a little insane. She has magical items which she sells, mainly as ornamental pieces, to rich nobles. Most have been taken from fools who crossed the Tomb Guard, or otherwise obtained through somewhat shady means and shipped here from other Elven communities.

Serode's shop is a strange, musty basement underneath the roots of a massive Shadowtop tree, accessed via what looks like a storm door. It's lit by driftglobes.
