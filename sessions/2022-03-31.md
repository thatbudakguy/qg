# Outline
## Bang
> You wake to the sounds of quiet conversation in Elvish from the common room below, and the smell of someone cooking something delicious in the kitchen. Rays of early spring sun filter in through the ancient leaded glass windows of the inn. Your host Mithriel is nowhere to be found. What do you do?
## Buy, sell, trade
### General goods
Some very dusty supplies are in the basement of the [unicorn-and-crescent-inn](../locations/evereska/unicorn-and-crescent-inn.md) for this purpose, although they may be so old as to not function (but they're free)! For everything else adventuring, you'd need to leave town, most likely. Mithriel could provide a tour, but she's not around...
### Weapons & Armor
#### Selling
PCs can sell some objects to the School of Arms, where the Quartermaster may keep them as training pieces for those who enlist in the Vale Guard or Tomb Guard.
#### Buying
There's one shop in town run by a collector named Serode, a female Elf who goes by only her first name and is a little insane. She has magical items which she sells, mainly as ornamental pieces, to rich nobles. Most have been taken from fools who crossed the Tomb Guard, or otherwise obtained through somewhat shady means and shipped here from other Elven communities.

Serode's shop is a strange, musty basement underneath the roots of a massive Shadowtop tree, accessed via what looks like a storm door. It's lit by driftglobes.

### Trinkets, art objects, etc.
Artisan shop called "The Sensible Romantic" owned by Eneleth and Galebor, a couple (two men). Eneleth: overweight, dresses in a silk kimono-like garment, similar to Gilmore, works front of house, poet, collector of reject wines. Galebor: shredded, short hair, speaks in a curt manner, practical, works back of house, makes daggers and wind sculptures. Far more willing to barter than they are to pay in coin, and may not have too many gold pieces with which to pay.

Most of what they want comes under the heading of pursuing hobbies, from collecting coins or weapons from places as far afield as Zakhara, to collecting magic. In exchange for items or equipment needed for the pursuit of his hobbies, they sell baubles: the tinkling blown glass and metal wind sculptures that hang in trees making soft music in the breezes from one end of the vale to the other; tiny ornamented, sapphire-adorned silver-bladed daggers that are much favored as hidden defenders among noble ladies all over Faerûn; vintages considered too poor for Evereskan tables; small poems set down in exquisite calligraphy on slabs of ivory or the like in delicate hanging frames; practice or rejected works of art such as paintings, statuettes, and carved boxes.
