# Scenes
## Araevin's Arrival
- requests they meet him at the council chambers in the palace
- has been meeting with lady laeral silverhand, conferring re: whether Declan is chosen.
- lady silverhand is sure of it too. echo of silver fire here?
- once there were many chosen, and we were almost like a small family, with our loves and our squabbles...
- i had seven sisters, but we grew apart over the centuries. then they began to fall. some disappeared early (the one engaged to sammaster, also a chosen). others established successful border kingdoms (silverymoon), later to vanish. the whereabouts of elminster aumar, the sage of shadowdale, are unknown...i am the last, and i can feel my power fading.
- I took a husband, a proud mage with a black staff, who established his tower here in the city. His name was Khelben Arunson, and he too could speak directly with the lady of mysteries.
- for a time, you could say we were a power couple. Khelben was a great friend to the Open Lord Piergeiron, who built this palace, and rose to become one of the great leaders in the history of the Harpers. But his power gained us friends and enemies in equal measure.
- eventually we two also grew apart, in the manner of people who are long married. he spent more and more time away, and i became...enmeshed in this city and its politics. the last time i saw him he was preparing to lead his faithful to lift an old spell-curse said to be placed by the elves at a place called Hellgate Keep.
- in fact, the archmage has helped me put one last piece of the puzzle into place. I now believe that what my husband intended to do – what he did, in fact, do, and what likely caused his disappearance – was to use an artifact to dispel or destroy the magic of Hellgate Keep. that artifact was the Gatekeeper's Crystal.
- araevin explains that this is likely how Gensor found his shard. if it was used or left in the vicinity of Hellgate Keep, he could have stolen or obtained this information from the Harpers, and made his own visit to the site.
- if the gang is going to assemble the full crystal, lady silverhand begs them not to use it the way that her husband did. 
## Silmerhelve Villa
- Dala greets them and tells them that Lady Saerista has been awaiting their arrival.
- lady saerista is there and informs them that they will need to journey with her in her human form to the outskirts of the city, outside the gates, where she can transform in order to carry them to the Nether Mountains where the dragons gather. It is a remote place inaccessible to most humanoids, near the peak of the mountain called Dalagar's Dagger, about 600 miles from Waterdeep as the dragon flies.
- because of aghairon's dragonward, she cannot take her dragon form within the boundaries of the city. the magic is old, but it still retains some power.
## Road to the Gates
- zora is waiting for them with a bunch of her own thugs.
	- pria, assassin, sexy, guns???
	- "whirlwind" wiley, glasses, martial arts adept, also a former member of the foxteeth
	- tunui, a dark-skinned man with two shortswords
- killing varick didn't get rid of the bounty on Peregrine's head.
- if pressed, maybe Zora is down to flip a coin? she has a weird religious luck/harvey dent vibe.
