# Scenes
## Traveller's Cloak
- frame up to the next morning. You wandered across the many canals and bridges of the docks quarter until you arrived at a large establishment in the north end, at a crossroads with many people coming and going at all hours.
- things you see:
	- huge two-sided fireplace that occupies the center of the room, with 20 or 30 tables arranged all around it, and a dining room off the main area in an L-shape where a buffet has been set out
	- people wearing tabards and other heavy clothing and the "sailor's hat" uniform of mulmaster with wyvern
	- a table of Thayans with shaved heads in wrapped robes with a young boy sitting on a small stool patiently waiting/watching them

> [!QUESTION] How do your senses that tells you that this is an upscale establishment?

Insight checks or similar will reveal the presence of both Salvar and Groshin:
- Salvar is dressed in the garb of the Cloaks, but appears nervous, picking at his food and flicking his eyes between a journal that sits open in front of him and other people in the room. He sizes up the party, looks to the door, looks at other cloaks, etc.
- Groshin, by contrast, is utterly relaxed, yet has chosen what is very obviously the most secure seat in the building, in a rear corner with excellent view of nearly the entire building. He has strange paint below his eyes. Occasionally people come over to his table to speak with him in a low voice and he will smile, nod, etc. Other hawks sit with him.

### Salvar
- sassy, somewhat flamboyant voice? prone to staring off in space, heavy sighs, etc. gets a little teary when talking about cyprian.
- reminds the party that they need to register if they're staying.
- is both noble (mother Desona Brix is a blade) and a cloak. his family name got him far, but not far enough to conceal his obvious lack of talent.
- knows that Thurndan was out conducting sea trials of the _Lady Dmitra_. pissed that he was not invited to be on the ship's maiden voyage. heard about blood on decks?
- former boyfriend Cyprian Balefrost was the one working closely with Gensor in the lab who figured out that the thing used in the scale model of the weapon was the GKC
- has been staking out the Traveller's Cloak to try to overhear or catch a sign that one of the Cloaks here was the one who betrayed Cyprian.
- will talk to the PCs, but not unless it's in the safety of a room or someplace outside the inn.
- has Cyprian's notes because he left them with Salvar ("I just feel like he was trying to tell me something!"), but can't get access to Cyprian's personal effects, which are stored in a safe that only opens using his personal seal in the Tower of Arcane Might.
- Thinks Declan looks a bit like Cyprian...Cyprian was a _sorcerer_. He had _dragon blood_. (he starts crying)
### Groshin
fast-talking, mid-atlantic accent type voice.

- reminds the party that they need to register if they're staying.
- "i have a special talent. i can see many places all at once." offers to sell information

## Leon's Locks
- Located in a partially abandoned multi-story building that seems like it was once a grand library or official building, but has long since fallen into disrepair.
- things you sense:
	- Leon's place is falling apart, with buckets to catch the rain, moldering stacks of parchment and scrolls, strange tools scattered everywhere, iron half-bent into strange shapes, and a noticeable rat problem. The sounds of clockwork echo through the building.

> [!QUESTION] How do your senses that tells you that this place is falling apart?

- Leon leans heavy on his cane. He does not recognize Calcey, since she did not go to see him during the Year of Rain. He responds in typically crotchety manner, stating that the shop is open by appointment only.
- Leon seems to have developed a drinking problem. He takes a moment to understand Calcey's plight, but offers to drink with her to celebrate her return. He is clearly inebriated and his hands shake, perhaps from DTs.
- What Leon knows:
	- A little over a month ago, Leon double-crossed the leader of the Hangmen, a Zhent gang that was one of the few still operating. He told Huru Cuttlescar, the sorcerer who led the gang, that he had learned from some longshoremen at the Rusty Chock that a shipment of rare Lantanese lenses was due in at the docks. At the same time, Leon tipped off the corrupt Groshin Lor, an old customer, hoping for payback. Sure enough, the authorities caught Huru and his henchmen, but Leon never saw any profit from the whole thing. Leon's hands shake now, and it's hard to work on the locks and picks without a new lens...perhaps Calcey could do an old friend a favor and track down one of those lenses? Maybe it ended up impounded at Southroad and never made it out? Could make it worth her while...
	- Groshin's become a trafficker in information, and his sources seem unnervingly good. If you need to know something, you can find him at the Traveller's Cloak. Soldiers, Hawks, and Cloaks frequent that bar, and even the occasional Blade may drop in. Not a cheap spot though.
	- The Heart of Thay, the priceless ruby rumored to have been the dowry of Dmitra Flass, First Princess of Thay, once stolen by Calcey at the annual jewelry auction, has resurfaced. Leon knows who has it, but that information will cost (It was given as a gift of friendship to Khazarkh Tola Vrass by High Blade Jaseen Drakehorn, but Leon knows that Groshin stole it because he built a custom pick for Groshin to inflitrate the Thayan Embassy.)
