# Scenes
## Opening
> A day has passed since the Draakhorn again sounded in Waterdeep, rocking the city to its core. Doomsayers are out in the streets, predicting the end of days, and the populace is noticeably more guarded, though some still remain cheerful. 

> [!QUESTION] How have you passed this day?
## Council
### Convening the Council
> Describe entering the Lord's Palace.

"Candlekeep" music from Town playlist?

Ren has some last-minute advice for the gang.
- I've pulled a lot of strings to get you a place here and make sure your voice is heard. Please don't make me look like a fool...my father would like it entirely too much.
- Take note of the names, faces, and titles of the Councilmembers. Try to address them using their titles. Formality goes a long way in situations like this.
- If you have questions about any of them afterwards, I'll tell you everything I know. For now — we need their support, whatever we do!

> [!QUESTION] What do you hope will happen at the meeting?

After the gang enter the council chambers, Declan sees Lady Silverhand (show portrait image) staring at him intently. For a moment, her eyes flash fully silver.

### Council Rules
Ren lays out some rules for how the council will function, reiterating what he stated to the delegates via letter previously.

> Honored lords and ladies, I am greatly indebted to you for your presence here today. I am Lord Renaer Neverember of the great city of Waterdeep, and I have gathered you here together to address the threat of the Cult of the Dragon. I will begin by laying out my hope for the structure of this council, which I sent to you previously by letter.

- Delegates staying in Waterdeep are welcome to remain in the City of Splendors at their leisure until the matters facing the council have been satisfactorily addressed. If they require assistance with accommodations, Ren is the person to contact.
- Any member of the council may forward a motion for debate. If the council agrees to vote on a motion, then a majority will be sufficient to carry the motion forward. As honored members of the Council, the Quarantine Gang is accorded one vote as a group.
- The council is thus composed of twelve voting members. As secretary, Ren will not vote unless his vote is required to break a tie. Members absent from council meetings will be considered to have abstained unless notice is provided otherwise. King Connerad Brawnanvil of Mithral Hall and Ser Isteval of the Dalelands are still making the journey to Waterdeep and will abstain from this session.
- The proceedings and decisions of this council *must* remain secret. Its members have gathered here in the knowledge that they are the best — indeed, the only — hope to ending the threat of the Cult of the Dragon. To that end, the enemy cannot be allowed to infiltrate this room.

### Reports from the Council
As each councilmember gives their report, introduce and describe them.
#### Harpers (Lady Haventree)
https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/images/3254952/remaliahaventreecaption.jpg

> It has been two years since I lost my husband to these terrorists who call themselves the cult of the dragon. Our spies in the East tell us that the Cult has been in decline, its fortunes dashed when the great wyrm Claugilyamatar of the Kryptgarden Forest withdrew her support in favor of these upstart followers of Tiamat. Now in a matter of months it seems they are everywhere: one cannot visit any city or town on the Sword Coast without bumping into a black-clad recruiter, whispering promises of favor and riches when the Queen of Dragons makes her return to the realms. Though our comrades in the East may not suffer from their presence as we do, I have come here today to assure this council that the _full_ support of the Harpers backs action against the Cult of the Dragon. I believe we succeed if we strike at the Cult's leadership — those who bear the dragon masks. Cut off the head, and the dragon will die.

#### Order of the Gauntlet (Vindicator Ontharr Frume)
short and stout man with a long russet-colored beard and several visible scars, his left arm has been replaced with a metal and wood prosthetic up to the elbow.

> I lost an arm in battle to these dragon-worshippers, fighting alongside miss Calcey and her friends at Kryptgarden forest. We need to hit them where they live. wherever the cult's stronghold is, the council should mass forces and move on it immediately. the longer we wait, the greater the forces the cult will gather. the evil must be stamped out at the root. With respect to lady Haventree and the Harpers, waiting shows weakness. Some of you might bring more honeyed words to this table, but that's the simple truth.

#### Wild Elves of the Realms (King Melandrach)
Elven man with long braids wearing ornate, turquoise elven battle armor. He has intricate tattoos around his eyes and ears. Haughty

> after the crash of skyreach, my court in the Misty Forest was attacked by forces on dragonback. they razed villages in the Misty Forest, choosing moments when I was distracted to make their attacks, almost as though they knew just when and where to strike. but these assaults quickly tapered off. we were able to resolve things in conversation with our cousins of the mountain home (evereska). retaliation now would be most unwise. we should wait for the cult to expose itself before taking action. they have already demonstrated their rashness. let them come to us.
#### Emerald Enclave (Chief Ranger Delaan Winterhound)
tall, thin half-elven ranger who seems nervous and out of place. he wears heavy winter clothes.

> Everywhere the balance of nature is subverted. the lull in attacks in the Misty Forest that King Melandrach discussed may be only temporary; the Enclave believes that the Cult will advance a new wave of attacks now that it is emboldened by these...sound events. Moreover, the dragonrider who is mounting the attacks is an elf, and reports say he has the green dragon mask. this and more has been told to me by the Treants.
#### City of Baldur's Gate (Marshall Ulder Ravengard)
https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/images/3254962/UlderRavengardCaption.jpg

description
> the countryside around baldur's gate, particularly the greenfields and areas near Elturgard, have been hit hard. Scornubel was nearly leveled by a dragon attack, and the city will take years to recover its economic losses. where will caravans headed east on the trade way resupply? agree with Frume: we must move against the cult stronghold now. The Flaming Fist will lead the charge. There is no better-prepared fighting force in all the realms.
#### City of Neverwinter (Lord Neverember)
https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/cd0917f8-e55f-454a-aeae-7d3d7c3bb79a/dcxj9zl-761fe2f9-1fbb-4e5e-87dc-6ba3c84fdb6b.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcL2NkMDkxN2Y4LWU1NWYtNDU0YS1hZWFlLTdkM2Q3YzNiYjc5YVwvZGN4ajl6bC03NjFmZTJmOS0xZmJiLTRlNWUtODdkYy02YmEzYzg0ZmRiNmIuanBnIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.llZfvGlGsy3Xl7g4KUkKQ3sQO5JHr0sFQanoTEViLXs 

> more than two score years have passed since the eruption of Mount Hotenow, called by ambassador brawnanvil's people Glaurimm. as you know, the destruction wrought on Neverwinter was near-total. Since leaving the office of Open Lord of Waterdeep and assuming the Protectorship of Neverwinter, I have invested all my efforts and at considerable personal cost succeeded in restoring the city's government and its guilds. now, all my work is threatened by these criminals who relentlessly recruit on every street corner, and hoard wealth that should be used to build infrastructure for people. I want them gone, but I do not have the resources to fund a lengthy and expensive military campaign. We must explore other options for ending this crisis. The people of the sword coast will not suffer war!
#### High Elves of the Realms (Araevin Teshurr)
> i personally witnessed the crash of Skyreach Castle. I would advise this council that the cult has in its employ exceedingly dangerous soldiers in addition to dragons — the QG and I together vanquished an elder vampire who threatened the entire city of Evereska. The city of Evereska does not engage in military actions beyond the Greycloak hills, and I have been instructed by the Council of Hill Elders to avoid such an action at all costs. However...we will help however we can.
#### City of Silverymoon (High Mage Hornblade)
https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/images/3254990/TaernHornbladeCaption.jpg
> i remind this council, particularly those members too young to remember the events of the previous century, that rash action has cost the leaders of the realms dearly in the past. The Silver Marches have no intention of committing military forces to an expedition without proof that it will end the threat of the Cult. We hear the red wizards...abomination.
#### City of Waterdeep (Lady Silverhand)
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/0/01/Laeral-5e.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20181208034828

Beautiful woman of indeterminate age, silver hair intricately braided and pulled behind her head, wearing a gilt-edged white cloak, the full dress uniform of the Open Lord. She seems almost carved from stone, hardly breathing, but then suddenly her eyes will flash as she looks at you across the table. Speaks with a slight british accent.

> I am going to tell a story. in the year 861, by the reckoning of the dales, my sister Alustriel introduced to me a man who sought her hand in marriage. he was tall, thin, and very nervous, but i could tell immediately that he had been chosen by Mystra, the Lady of Mysteries, just as myself and all six of my sisters. his name was Sammaster, and when my sister refused his hand, a poison began to grow in his heart. ten years later, without warning, he attacked her. Myself and my husband answered her call for aid, but we were too late. We subjected Sammaster to a terrible punishment, and thereafter Mystra stripped him of his status as a Chosen of the gods. But the poison had taken root, and began translating ancient prophecies, obsessed with the idea of undead dragons as rulers of the realms. In the year 916 I and my husband ambushed Sammaster as he traveled in the forest of Cormanthyr. With the aid of the Harpers, we slew him then, showing no mercy, as he had shown none to my sister. So the centuries have passed...my husband is long gone. My sisters, one by one, fell in battle, gave themselves to noble causes, or disappeared from this plane entirely. Yet still here I am, alone. Perhaps I am the last of my kind. Perhaps not. But Sammaster, it seems, is not done with me. These cultists no longer seek to raise undead dragons, I am told. It makes no difference to me. I have lost too much to this man and his followers already. I will lose no more.




#### Quarantine Gang
Ren asks the QG to speak.
