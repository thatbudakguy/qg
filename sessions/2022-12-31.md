# Recap
![a3e35](logbook/act-iii/a3e35.md)
# Scenes
## Maccath's Chamber
- she has a ring of cold resistance and two arrows of dragon slaying to give them
## Scriptorium
> Three shelves stand in this otherwise empty cavern, cobbled together out of salvaged wood, whale bone, pieces of giants' armor, and even the frozen limbs of yetis. A number of scrolls, books, parchments, and folios are carefully arranged on the shelves, all bearing the markings of magical writing.

- checking for a piece of knowledge here is a DC 15 Investigation check; Maccath can help if it's something she would know about (advantage).
- failure prompts a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to stop reading dangerous stuff. if you fail that, you are psychically shocked and have DA on attack rolls and ability checks and need to make a DC 10 con check to cast any spell. you can save each long rest to end the effect.
- chute in here leads to the lair. 15 feet wide, 60 feet down to roof of lair then another 15ft drop to the ice platforms. can't come back up. need rope system to get down.
