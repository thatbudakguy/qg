# Outline

## Journey to Nimlith

We open with the sentry shouting (in Elvish) "It's the halfling! Everyone scatter!"

### Veldann camp encounter

- notes in the camp with orders from Governor Veldann:
  - don't harm the outsiders, on pain of death
  - Coronal Ilsevele must have given them sort of method of entry; watch for it
  - if you are discovered, eliminate any who challenge you. we cannot lose this opportunity

- signs that the soldiers have been beefing with/annoyed by the dryads? or that they charmed some and led them away

- the Durothil soldiers were given info suggesting that some barges remain and may be beneath the lake surface; the outsiders might have been told where they are?

### Lake of Dreams

- The lake of dreams has mermaids living in it?
- Crustaids, huge tentacled monstrosities that defend the lake and swallow/regurgiate metal and treasure
- defunct sky barges
  - variously sized, slim canoe-like ships made of clockwork mithril with delicate dragonfly-like "wings" that could lift them up to the palace

### Dryad Grove

- portal on land via a shrine to Hanali Celanil (the bathing pool) that accesses same shrine in the Palace
  - dryads that live around here know about it
  - also about a crashed sky barge that is underwater in the lake
- to activate the portal, you have to swim down to the depths of the pool



## Journey to Corellon's Grove

### Characters

#### Declan Truefire

Wants:

- to figure out if Ilsevele is his mom, and if so, why??????? abandon???
- who is my dad?
- connect to his elven heritage

Hiding:

#### Araevin Teshurr

Wants:

- to be reminded that he is an Elf
- to know that Ilsevele still loves him
- to see Declan attain his full power as a Chosen of Mystra

Hiding:

- Araevin once had a familiar, Whyllwyst, a gray falcon. Whyllwyst was killed by a group of drow assassins in the Underdark. Araevin has never forgiven himself for not being able to save her.
- Araevin founded the Company of the White Star, an adventuring group that included his fiancee Ilsevele, the human priest of Lathander Grayth Holmfast, and the air genasi rogue Maresa Rost. When the Daemonfey attacked Evermeet and stole a shard of the Gatekeeper's Crystal, the Company was sent to recover it. They failed, and the shard was used to open a portal to the Abyss and take over Myth Drannor. Grayth died in the search for the Crystal. Araevin disbanded the Company and lost touch with Maresa.
- Araevin never understood why Corellon would bless Seiveril's returning of Starbrow from Arvandor, but when he saw Starbrow and Ilsevele together, it wounded him deeply to see how clearly happy Ilsevele was. He undertook the Tel'Miirkara'Neshyr partly out of shame, thinking Seiveril had effectively replaced him with Starbrow in Ilsevele's heart.
- The final shard of the crystal may have returned to one of the places Araevin was never able to go: deep in the Yuirwood of Aglarond. Ancient legends describe a mythal like the one that created evermeet, but cast by a mythical race of "Star Elves" who disappear from the historical record tens of thousands of years ago. They refused to participate in the mythal that raised Evermeet, electing to withdraw from the world instead.

#### Ilsvele Miritar

Wants:

- an apology from Araevin for choosing magic over her
- forgiveness from Declan for having abandoned him
- to know that Araevin still loves her

Hiding:

- When Araevin and Ilsevele were young and traveling together on the Continent, she received a prophecy from an old Gur woman that she would "court three loves and lose them all, be twice crowned and twice dethroned, and bear but one child to be raised by another's hand."
- On the hundredth anniversary of her marriage, Starbrow begged to be returned to his family and his rest in Arvandor. Ilsevele granted his wish.
- Declan's father was named Arclath Obarskyr, the son of King Azoun V of Cormyr and rightful heir to the throne, who answered Ilsevele's call for aid. He was an excellent dancer, a shameless flirt, and completely hopeless as a soldier. He died in the battle for Myth Drannor. She knew him for 11 days.
- Just before the city fell, on Elminster's orders, the pregnant Ilsevele fled, alone, to Semberholme to be cared for by the Giants who still dwelt there, and kept the old shield-wards active. But the boy child was growing at an alarming rate, far faster than even a human child should. She was in incredible pain, suffering strange contractions where heatless silver fire would erupt around her body. Giving birth alone in the forest, she left the child in the care of the Giants, and emerged from hiding to guide the Retreat of her remaining people back to Evermeet.
