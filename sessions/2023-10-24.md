# Scenes
## Silmerhelve Villa
> [!WARNING] Make a perception check. Highest roll sees someone who has tailed you here, and now disappears.

- Dala greets them but is confused why they have returned so soon. She wants to know what has happened.
- "Lady Saerista" (Otaaryliakkarnos) is here, if pressed.
	- She uses _detect thoughts_ in a way that suggests she wants P to know she is using it.
	- What is on the surface of P's mind?
- Her questions for Peregrine ("what do you think about" vs. "what do you say"):
	- Why did you leave?
	- How did you come to the faith of the Platinum Dragon?
	- Are there crimes for which there is no forgiveness?
- If Peregrine yields and seems to be truthful, he gains the trust of the Metallic Dragons. Otaaryliakkarnos tells him the truth.
	- The Metallic Dragons are planning to assemble their own council, headed by Protanther, a Great Wyrm and King of Justice.
	- By tradition such a council should involve humanoid representatives. But, the Council of Waterdeep has not provided any representatives that appeal to the dragons yet â€“ and some are actively repellent (in particular, the elves and dwarves).
	- If P is willing, Otaaryliakkarnos will fly him to the sanctuary in the Nether Mountains where the dragons gather. It is a remote place inaccessible to most humanoids, near the peak of the mountain called Dalagar's Dagger, about 600 miles from Waterdeep as the dragon flies. That would take two days, but Otaaryliakkarnos will fly the party there. To do that, she has to get out of Waterdeep.
## Phlan
- the Thayan ship and its envoy were eventually recalled. They haven't heard anything since, but the blockade seems to still be active.
- The rumor is that Zhentil Keep is planning to leave the League after all.
## Nomad Village
> [!QUESTION] (Hagar) The village was always on the move, but you think you know where to find them. Where, and why do you know?

> [!QUESTION] (Hagar) What's the first thing you do when you get back?

After the PCs arrive, the village holds a feast in their honor. They prepare _Korkog_, which is a special stew made with potatoes and the meat of a large beast of burden similar to a yak.

> The connection to the primal spirits, Ullo explains, predates even the arrival of the Eraka to the Ride. The oldest stories tell of a first age, where the people lived in a great forest that was warm and tangled, one filled with the energy that created the world, where trees grew to touch the sky. The primal spirits dwelt there, but a great cataclysm drove them from the forest, forcing the Eraka to flee and become nomads, forever wandering the realms. Since that time the spirits have spoken to their people only sporadically through the totems.

Legends (songs) that the Eraka know about Myth Ondath:
- After the arrival of the Eraka in the The Ride, there was a great battle far to the north, where the snow falls heavy in winter. Desert sprites fought with angels in the bitter cold, led by a man with no skin. To end the war, the gods had to tear up the land itself and kill everyone. That place is cursed; no one travels there willingly. The land still echoes with the cries of the sprites in the wind.
- Some say that the angels haunt that place still, and that when you are down to your last scraps of meat with no horse, they will appear to carry you off to the pure land of grass and water.

### Hagar's Playmate
- someone comes forward to guide the gang to the Tortured Land. This person was a former childhood acquaintance of Hagar, and is the only person other than Ullo who knows the truth about Hagar's _Meklejumi_. describe them:
	- were they close friends, or bitter enemies with Hagar?
	- what made them the pride of the village, someone adults loved and other children looked up to?
	- what is their signature weapon?
	- pronouns & name

## Council of Dragons
### Dragon attack
The party have been tailed in Waterdeep, and their plan to fly north with Otaaryliakkarnos is discovered. The Cult sends assassins to meet them mid-flight.

### The Council
The Council meets at sacred burial grounds for metallic dragons, near the peak of the sheer mountain called Dalagar's Dagger. Scales and bones from metallic dragons have been used to create a simple shrine to Bahamut here. Frayed banners with prayers written in draconic whip in the high mountain wind.
