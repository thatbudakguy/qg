## Opening
an attention-grabbing way to start the session off.

the second council of waterdeep meets on this day.
arcane brotherhood contacts the gang?

what happens when they try to pick/open the safe
- combo lock part has to be picked, but it's suspiciously easy for calcey
what else is in the safe?
- lens in a velvet bag
- the lens itself is only about 6" across, but the surface of is is oddly oily, like an oil slick spread across smoked glass. looking through it, you can make out what's on the other side, but the outlines of things seem to shift and blur eerily until you bring it just up to your eye, at which point things become almost hyperrealistically clear. items tens of feet away are magnified to perfect, precise detail.
- if the lens is used as a material component while casting an arcane spell, it confers the effects of the "heightened spell" and "distant spell" metamagic (together) without the need to expend sorcery points. it must be held in one hand and concentration must be maintained for the spell's duration.
