# Outline
## Bang
> The Archmage turns to you. "If our archives can be of any help to you, what's mine is yours. Where do we start?"
## Waterdeep
- about the cult's base of operations: Leosin or whoever is contacted would ask if the PCs remember where Skyreach was going, since if it was delivering treasure for Tiamat, maybe its final destination was the cult stronghold
- Araevin remembers talking about this and vaguely remembers that the Well of Dragons is sacred to dragons.
## Research
**Thay and the Red Wizards**
(INT)
- A Red Wizard was first encountered in the Valhingen catacombs attempting to tunnel to the Pool of Radiance using undead as diggers. He vanished while his guardian Knight held off the Gang.
- At the Battle of Kryptgarden, the gang surprised a Red Wizard named Zaralda who was raising Elven dead as servants from a graveyard. She carried a spellbook and a letter written in an unfamiliar language.
- On the journey north to the Carnath Roadhouse from Waterdeep, the Gang traveled with a (poorly) disguised Red Wizard named Azbara who seemed to be trying to avoid the spotlight. He later appeared at Castle Naerytar but acted aloof, meeting with the Gang privately rather than revealing them. Azbara explained about the Thayan Resurrection effort and said he was associated with someone named Rath Modar, who was apparently leading it.
- This same wizard turned up on board Skyreach, where Declan used *comprehend languages* to overhear him arguing in a foreign language with another wizard about the ritual, who later attempted to seize the dragon mask and forcibly crashed the castle by ejecting Blagothkus from it.
- Hagar found half of a strange grimoire written in an unfamiliar language in the wreckage of the Red Wizard's chambers aboard Skyreach.

(HIST)
- Thay is Located far to the East, nearly as far from the Moonsea as the Moonsea is from the Sword Coast. Dominated by high plateaus.
- Thay has a nominal government but is functionally magocratic, with the autonomous Red Wizards controlling society. They answer to none but their superiors and are fanatically defended by the "knights" of Thay.
- Thay has been under the dominion of powerful necromancers for generations. Its leader, the lich Szass Tam, is a paranoid ruler who drives all who oppose him to exile or death. Whispers say that undead are more common than the living on the streets.
- Thay has become an isolated pariah state. It maintains embassies in some major cities like Waterdeep, but institutionalized slavery means the rest of Faerun shuns it while quietly profiting from trade in food and magical items.

**The Well of Dragons**
- The Caldera of an extinct stratovolcano. Located near northern terminus of the Sunset Mountains, about halfway between Sword Coast and Moonsea. Actually quite close to Evereska, which might explain some things...
- Long used as a sacred burial ground for dragons who were ready to die of old age.
- The Old Cult under Sammaster took over the Well and used it as a place to transform Dragons into Dracoliches, building it out into a base of operations.
- The letter that Talis wrote to give to the Gang was (theoretically) supposed to be given to someone in command (Naergoth Bladelord) when Skyreach reached its final destination: the Well.

### Defenses
- Trepsin was left in command here, but Talis and all of her attendant Cultists have decamped for the Well of Dragons. She was summoned there by Severin following the death of Rezmir, as she had hoped.
- Trepsin has orders to attack on sight anyone who comes close to the building, since nobody should be visiting it at this point: the treasure delivery network is down with Skyreach's destruction.
- Trepsin and one other Troll are still on staff, along with six guard drakes.
- If day, 50% chance that the Perytons are also hunting.
### Servants
- The Kobolds and servants are still here, but beyond Trepsin, they're the only ones. The human servants (sleeping in room 13) who formerly worked for Lord Marsten (who Talis killed) are:
	- Arlaenga, head maid, loyal to Talis and a snitch
	- Gastyn, chief butler
	- Angrath Woodwise, former chief hunter, hates Trepsin and could be turned
- The humans know why Talis left, and they also know about Cult's secret meeting room (room 20). They also know about the Perytons.
### Captives
- The captives in the basement are:
	- Craggnor the Dwarf, cultist and friend of Varram, who Talis was attempting to (unsuccessfully) torture and interrogate
	- Miresella, a young woman from Baldur's Gate who came to Parnast with a caravan and asked too many questions
	- Brother Caemon, priest of Amaunator from Hillsfar who mysteriously has not been tortured and doesn't know why
- Craggnor knows why Talis left and where she is, and he also knows that Severin will never make her Wyrmspeaker without a mask, which is why she's been taking her anger out on him extra bad. He'll make a deal to tell them this information if they release him unharmed.
