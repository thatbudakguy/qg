# Outline
## Bang
> You appear in an oval cave carved from solid glacial ice, with no passages leading out. The ceiling is 30 feet high and lined with icicles, and bits of broken ice surround a massive white marble sarcophagus situated in the middle of the floor. The lid of the sarcophagus is sculpted into the likeness of a female giant with long flowing hair.

The sarcophagus is 20 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet tall. Dwarvish runes carved into its base spell the name ESCLAROTTA. The lid of the sarcophagus requires a DC 30 Strength check to push aside, and the bones of Blagothkus’s deceased cloud giant wife are contained within. There is no treasure buried with her.

A creature in this tomb that speaks the name “Blagothkus” is instantly teleported to the ground floor of Esclarotta's tower.
## Steering Tower
Blagothkus has secured the door to this tower with an *arcane lock*. It can be opened normally by a giant or by a *knock* spell. For everyone else, breaking it down is largely impossible, because a DC 70 Strength check is required.
> A staircase of ice leads from the tower’s ground floor to a higher chamber, the walls and ceiling of which gleam and glitter: jewels are everywhere in the room. You see glowing moonstones, thumb-sized emeralds, shining silvery mithral wands, and strange spheres covered in turquoise and gold, as well as dozens of copper levers and golden spheres embedded in the walls. After a moment, the walls themselves seem to disappear, providing a perfect aerial view in all directions, as if there were no castle and no cloudstuff around. More than a dozen glowing white runes flicker in and out of existence, drifting about the room like snowflakes.

The magic here now functions intermittently if at all. Esclarotta's spirit has fled, her binding to this world severed by the destruction of the castle.
