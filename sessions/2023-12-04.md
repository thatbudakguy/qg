# Scenes
## Dragonclaw Mine
Peregrine's find the way spell is indicating that they're getting close to Dragonclaw mine, after what seems like hours and hours of flying along with sudden random twists and turns through the inky blackness.

- dragonclaw mine was overrun by the duergar of clan Steelshadow, who occupy many parts of the underdark in the Moonsea North.
- The Steelshadow were driven south and upwards by the arrival of Hook Horrors a hundred years ago and pushed into the Copperpot mines in the Dragonspine Mountains

### Duergar Trap
> [!INFO] Duergar have advantage on saving throws against poison, spells, and illusions, as well as to resist being charmed or paralyzed.

- the PC's minecart suddenly drops into a 15ft deep pit, about 10ft on a side
	- 3d6 bludgeoning damage, DC 15 dex saving throw for half
- before the PCs can pick themselves up, torches go out, but there is a suddenly a blinding flash like the sun and roar of sound
	- blinded and deafened and 1d4 thunder damage, DC 15 CON saving throw for no effect
- those who aren't deafened hear muffled voices outside in Dwarvish saying "we got something in the old minecart trap! hurry!"
- couple of duergar plus one mind master. (Kramdar) flee if reduced, then send hammerers after them.
- plan is to bring captured PCs before the Deep King (duergar warlord Barud Steelshadow).
