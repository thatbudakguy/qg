# Recap
- Calcey returned with a new clockwork leg
- Gang visited a house in the North Ward that belonged to Peregrine's uncle Jaeger.
- Nobody was home. You noticed he didn't seem to have lived there long, and he was likely killed there and it was poorly covered up.
- Peregrine found a fox incisor belonging to Zora, the hotheaded and mercurial second-in-command of the foxteeth, a devotee of Tymora
- Someone also found a cache of letters under a floorboard written from Peregrine's mother Helga to Jaeger, his uncle, describing her flight from Candlekeep to Waterdeep
- A short letter addressed to Peregrine himself was left in the bedroom as a trap, which had a glyph that triggered a fireball when it was read.
- Hagar conjured an indoor sleet storm to stop the flames, but Cult assassins entered the building to finish off the gang
- When Peregrine came downstairs he found Varick, his former handler, in command of the assassins trying to finish you off.
- The battle spilled out into the street, as shouts of passerby indicated the City Watch were on their way. Declan blasted V with _magic missile_.
# Scenes
## Street Battle
- no initiative
- dueling clocks for capturing Varick and City Watch arriving
- assassins are surrounding you, blocking your path out of the house. further up the street are one or two with crossbows in windows
### GM moves
- Assassins duck behind a wagon
- A dray goes by, blocking your view
- You hit someone you didn't intend to
- A noble and their entourage try to break up the fight
- D sees a scrying sensor
### Interrogating Varick
- where does it happen?
- who is in this scene?
	- people can take turns explaining how they get Varick to reveal something, or just roleplay.
What Varick knows:
- He put a bounty on Peregrine's head of 10,000gp when he never turned up after doing the Temple of Bahamut job. There was way too much heat to leave a loose end. The city never stopped investigating it; one of the high-up harpers kept pushing them because her husband died in it.
- A long time passed, but eventually one of his informants brought him a story about a young woman "Z" who was known as an arms dealer and who claimed to have known P
- Varick watched her pull off a job stealing weapons intended for the city and making it seem like a clerical error. He found out somebody else was watching too: the Zhents she owed.
- He approached her with an offer she couldn't refuse: just tell him how to set a trap for P and let him know when he'd resurface. They tried to pull it off months ago, but P was already gone by the time they set it up. They decided to just leave it up and stake out J's house.
- He didn't even want to kill Jaeger. He remembered him from P's earlier days. Z suggested they flip a coin. When she saw the result, she volunteered to do it.
- Killing Varick won't erase the bounty on P's head.
