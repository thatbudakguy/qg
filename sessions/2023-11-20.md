# Scenes
## Opening
Declan sees the umber hulk come out and put its feelers to the ground, then head back to the landing where hagar and calcey are.

Next round, another one bursts out next to them.
## Ticklebelly Mine

To get out of here, we need a few things:
- a functional powered minecart (with fuel and a gear)
- knowledge of which track takes the bypass
- 

### Outpost
#### War Room
This room has a long table about 20ft long with a stone relief carving depicting the entire Dragonspine mountain range taking up the center of the table. It could comfortably seat a Dwarven Mining Council with many members.

**Discoveries**
- The carvings have labels in Dwarvish indicating major mine locations. This mine appears to be called Ticklebelly Mine, and it was mining copper. Closest to this mine is another one marked on the opposite (North) side of the range, labeled Dragonclaw Mine. An arrow is carved into the rock pointing in the direction of Dragonclaw Mine, with a distance measurement.
- In a folio containing moldering parchment with an explorer's report in Dwarvish, including field sketches. The report describes the near-total loss of the Dwarven expedition to find a potential route across the Glacier of the Silver Blades, with the members being decimated by an attack from huge white furry beasts. The commander only made it out because the beasts seemed to be repelled by fire. The report concludes that an overland crossing is too dangerous; a tunnel should be carved instead linking the mines.

#### Armory
This room has long hallways containing hooks for storing mining gear, along with storage lockers holding the equipment of the mining and exploration crews.

**Discoveries**
- Mining equipment: pickaxes, bullseye lanterns and pints of oil, shovels, [sticks of dynamite](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/dynamite-stick).
- A _Belt of Dwarvenkind_, in the storage locker of the mining foreman.

**Dangers**
- Two cloakers, posing as large leather mining cloaks

### Switching Yard
This area is littered with abandoned and destroyed minecarts. There are several sections of parallel track that run together, with hand-activated switches for moving minecarts from one track to another.

**Discoveries**
- A minecart containing a miniature steam engine, for powered movement uphill. The engine needs fuel or something to heat its boiler, and it's also missing a huge drive gear about 8 feet across that connects the flywheel and the two cart wheels (see https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Locomotive_trevithick.svg).
- Signs in Dwarvish indicating the distance to various parts of the mine (borehole, toren's vein, outpost, dragonclaw bypass, etc.)

#### Foundry
This huge room is located just off the switching yard, with several tracks that lead inside and an overhanging system of chains and hooks for moving carts around. There are four gargantuan furnaces, now cold and empty, with smelting troughs that run down into raised stone platforms where crucibles can be set to form iron parts. There is also a smaller furnace in the back of the room with a different design and no trough. 

**Discoveries**
- The smaller furnace was used for making small, finely worked copper parts â€“ and some mithril smithing. There is a locked chest next to it with a mithril breastplate inside (size medium).
- Replacement parts are piled in heaps near the furnaces. One of them contains a complete drive gear.
- There is ample charcoal here that could power the minecart.

**Dangers**
- A minecart that is suspended near the rear furnace is hanging on rusty chains, and if disturbed will begin to swing, then suddenly snap and fall on anyone nearby. They take 8d6 bludgeoning damage and are pinned under the cart, dex save to avoid it.
