> [!QUESTION] What gives you the juice?

scott: puzzles, doing silly shit for no reason (transforming into sexy versions). going back through old notes and things line up
vince: when it's clear what the objective is, video-gamey things, figuring out the best possible solution. structure. puzzles as an example. rolling dice and mechanics are good.
patrick: working cooperatively to find solutions, exploring the world. approaching things from different angles, distance betw. char & player
hannah: when the party is being silly together and doing stupid shit. tying character development to worldbuilding, weaving things together.

> [!QUESTION] If your character had time to pick up any artisanâ€™s tools, game set, instrument, etc., what would it be?

# Scenes
## Journey to the Village
The journey takes you up along the Stojanow River along the edge of the Quivering Forest, past Kabel's Hill, into the foothills of the Dragonspine Mountains. Finding a pass through the mountains will take you to The Ride, the great open expanse of scrubland that the Eraka people call home. You can reaching the foothills by the end of the first day, but finding a pass could be tricky. You'll need at least a few days' rations.

> [!QUESTION] (Everyone) What's one sign you can see that spring has finally come to the Moonsea?

[perilous-wilds](../notes/perilous-wilds.md)

On the Northern side of the Dragonspines is a small fortified mining town called Verdigris, which is a vassal territory of Phlan. A few hundred years ago, The Glacier of the Silver Blades overtook Old Verdigris, but has since retreated and revealed its ruins next to New Verdigris. The Spring of Voices is fed by runoff from the Glacier, and it's in the mountains nearby Verdigris.
