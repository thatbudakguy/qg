### Topics of Conversation
- Is the Iron Tiger real?
- Who stole the _Heart of Thay_ from Tola Zurn? Isn't it terribly embarrassing? Is it really the city's fault, though?
- Why isn't watchmaster Gareth Blackturret of Thentia in attendance? Is his health really failing?
- Isn't Tola's gown incredible? But Barthmolosquire's is even better...
- Have you gotten any magical items shipped in from Thay yet? I have some contacts. Everyone's doing it nowadays.
- Aren't the slavery practices of the Thayans barbaric? or are they really a more civilized people, who have conquered Death as we know it?
- What's the story with these rumors of rampant Dragon attacks on the Sword Coast?
- They say the area around Phlan has finally gotten safer in recent months. Two different notorious bandit gangs have been wiped out.
- Is Harlan an impish rogue, or a genuinely bad influence on our youth? Why are they so obsessed with him anyway?
- Commissioning art

### Event Sequence

## Inside the Tower

- what kinds of rooms are in the tower?
	- the "great corridor", the axis around which many of the outer towers were built over time, made of marble, incredible stained glass windows depicting mulmaster's founding, moonsea war, previous high blades, duels, etc.
	- Nesker's Study, former library of the mage who ruled the city when it was his residence in the pre-blade era. contains lots of old magical tomes, etc. Has one secret entrance to the Palace of Revels; it's the more openly known one and but fallen into disuse.
	- East Wing, where many of the newer merchant family apartments are located. 
	- the Gallery, where art commissioned by the noble families is exhibited. theoretically none of it is for sale, but in reality there is fierce competition and under the table bidding, whereas official everything is "gifted"

- what's the super-cool but now unused way to get into the palace of revels? how does the gang  find out about it?
- the Brix family, who would Salvar see here that he might know (scenes)
