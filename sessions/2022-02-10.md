# Outline
## Bang
> As Araevin opens the door, you catch a glimpse inside the grand two-story building. The interior is dotted with massive, well-worn wooden tables inlaid with silvery designs of moons and stars, and sparsely populated by young Elves in various states of revelry, misery, and boredom. Several wide-eyed faces turn to stare as you stand silhouetted in the doorway. "Mithriel!" Araevin shouts. "I think it's time for you to finally _do your job_."

Araevin promises to investigate Hazirawn and get back to the PCs, and that they can contact him via _sending_ or ask Mithriel at any time if they need something, or to get ahold of one of the Elders.
## Getting a Room
The PCs have arrived at the [unicorn-and-crescent-inn](../../locations/evereska/unicorn-and-crescent-inn.md). Mithriel will excitedly tend to them and explain anything they care to ask about her situation and the history of the inn. They can interact with the patrons; a group of first-year students is playing [Liar's Dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_dice) at one of the tables.
## The Next Day
**Update the calendar!**
On Ches 11, [Tomb Master Colbathin](../../npcs/kinyon-colbathin.md) sends [Captain Darthammel](../../npcs/rhaellen-darthammel.md) to fetch the PCs to aid in the exploration of the upper deck of [Skyreach](../../locations/evereska/skyreach-castle-wreck.md).

Captain Darthammel and his men will blindfold the PCs again to take The Passage under the [Hall of the High Hunt](../../locations/evereska/hall-of-the-high-hunt.md). Once at the castle, Trueshot will brief the PCs on the situation: his men are examining the lower deck, but have not entered the Upper Deck, since there's no obvious route and there may yet be dangerous survivors (unlikely, but possible.)
