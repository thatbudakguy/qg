> It is night on Ches 26rd, the sixth day since you left Waterdeep. The news that Oyaviggaton is not far off has set the crew of _Frostskimmr_ abuzz. Captain Half-Face has ordered that the ship be hauled onto an ice floe for the night. Sailcloth shelters have been rigged over the deck, and you are huddled around whale-oil lamps in the freezing cold while the crew prepares their bedrolls. Through the gaps in the sailcloth, great winding ribbons of green and purple light whip and crackle through the sky in slow motion. This is, without a doubt, the furthest from home you have ever been.

> [!QUESTION] Before you turn in for the night, what token of home do you revisit?
