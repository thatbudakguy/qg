# recap

- Declan regains consciousness in a strange, nightmarish world of black glass, where the landscape can seemingly be traversed at will and spells can be cast by thinking them. The landscape is populated by tall, hammer-wielding humanoids that seem to be locked in battle with a powerful mage. On closer inspection, this turns out to be none other than Open Lord of Waterdeep Laeral Silverhand, who is just as confused to see Declan inside her dream as he is to be there.
- Together, the two mages manage to enter the massive, foreboding pyramid that dominates the horizon of this world, where they are confronted with a deep humming noise and a visible current of magic leading through the corridors of black glass. Following the magical conduits leads them to a room where a gigantic woman is asleep inside a ring of iron that seems to be imprisoning her. After concentrating on the quasi-weave that seems to bind the woman to the ring, she is able to be freed and come awake, revealing that she is none other than the goddess Mystra herself.
- Mystra, realizing that time is short, explains that the world in which she was imprisoned is no dream: it is a demiplane created by the archmage Karsus, once her lover, to demonstrate the height of his power. In this place, Karsus's own weave takes the place of normal magic, which gives limitless power to the caster but was irretrievably corrupted by his casting of _Karsus's Avatar_, the spell that triggered the Spellplague in the Realms and killed a previous iteration of Mystra.
- Because Karsus's world is in a sense hidden and inaccessible to the gods, including Mystra, the Thayan Lich Szass Tam was able to use it as the secret location for his Phylactery, bringing the Chosen of other gods there to be consumed in secret. Knowing he could never defeat Mystra on her own ground, he lured her to Karsus's World and trapped her using Karsus' own Weave, keeping her alive so that ordinary magic would continue to function on the material plane and no one would be the wiser.
- Because Mystra cannot control Karsus's Weave, she relied on Laeral and Declan to destroy Szass Tam's phylactery, removing the secret to his immortality. Declan called down a pillar of heavenly fire to annihilate the giant crystal obelisk that had consumed so many souls, and when it was done, Mystra simply informed one of Szass Tam's innumerable rivals that he was no longer protected from death, and let the game run its course.
- Meanwhile, in the lower chamber of the Summer Palace, high above the Lake of Dreams, the rest of the Gang battled Giullio Moonflower in his giant four-armed automaton. The 'mech provided immune to ordinary damage, but its moving parts could be frozen with ice spells, and after Calcey lassoed the Crownblade and ripped it free from the mech's torso with a telekinesis blast, the power seemed to immediately drain from the rig.
- However, this had two immediate side effects: the palace itself suddenly seemed to power down and begin falling through the air. Moreover, the sword was ripped out of the mech's torso with 1000lb of force, causing it to be flung across the room and fall through a hole in the floor, tumbling out into the air over the lake. Although Giullio's mech has been badly damaged, the Gang are confronted with a rapidly escalating situation in which they must save themselves and recover the falling sword in a matter of seconds â€“ without touching it.

## summer palace

re-roll initiative to start

- giullio is doubled over as though he's been punched in the stomach. THe mech has huge gashes in it from hagar's claw tattoo and dents from the spiritual weapon
- the sword has only fallen a few feet through the ground, so far
- but, as time goes on, it'll fall much faster than the palace due to air resistance
- giullio's mech has foldable wings; he'll try to reclaim the sword and re-power the palace

## karsus's world

Mystra explains that it is time for Declan's investiture of spellfire, as a reward for freeing her and because he has come of age.

"I am proud of you...Though you have until now borne the name truefire, you have not yet wielded it..."

"While you wield spellfire, you will find that you neither thirst for drink nor hunger for food. Nor do you require sleep, nor even air to breathe, for your very existence is nourished by the Weave. The freezing cold of the north cannot harm you, nor the heat of the desert. Best of all, the weave is yours to bend at will. Metamagic requires only for you to think for it to become active, draining none of your sorcerous power. Spells fling themselves from your fingertips without expenditure of material or effort, just as they do in Karsus's world. But this power - like me - is capricious. The longer and more strenuously you wield it, the sooner it will slip from your grasp like a lover into the night. With every spell, you will fight to retain your grasp. Do not despair: your spellfire will always return to you, given time. This is merely a safeguard, placed by me so that my chosen are encouraged to show restraint. The man called Sammaster did not respect these limits, and he was punished by death. But you are so much more than he ever was..."

"Rise now. Preserve life, and punish those who seek to control others. Walk among the people of the world and show them the power of mystery."

## grove of corellon

- Declan's father was named Arclath Obarskyr, the son of King Azoun V of Cormyr and rightful heir to the throne, who answered Ilsevele's call for aid. He was an excellent dancer, a shameless flirt, and completely hopeless as a soldier. He died in the battle for Myth Drannor. She knew him for 11 days.
- Just before the city fell, on Elminster's orders, the pregnant Ilsevele fled, alone, to Semberholme to be cared for by the Giants who still dwelt there, and kept the old shield-wards active. But the boy child was growing at an alarming rate, far faster than even a human child should. She was in incredible pain, suffering strange contractions where heatless silver fire would erupt around her body. Giving birth alone in the forest, she left the child in the care of the Giants, and emerged from hiding to guide the Retreat of her remaining people back to Evermeet.
