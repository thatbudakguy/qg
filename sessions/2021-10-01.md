### Notes

- The Bullywugs flee on their next turn, seeing their numbers diminished and realizing that Pharblex must be dead. Bullywugs visibly flee from their treasure room, as well.
- Dralmorrer Borngray has expended a spell slot to cast *magic weapon* on his sword, which makes it a +1 magical weapon.
- *grease* affects the 10ft area around Dralmorrer Borngray and Calcey, since she uncorked *Villona's black goo* on top of both of them.
