# Scenes
## Battle
Current initiative:
1. peregrine
2. calcey
3. mend-nets (prone, t-rex)
4. declan
5. hagar
6. beauregard
7. troll 2 (will regenerate)
8. troll 1 (banished, will regenerate)
9. arauthator (has all legendary actions & 2 resistances left)

Peregrine's turn has just finished; begin with Calcey. **Arauthator flees at 50hp!**

## Aftermath
### Death of Arauthator
- Collapse of ice in the lair shakes the Iceberg; huge falling icicles hits peopl for 3d10 bludgeoning (DC 15 dex save to avoid)
- Kobolds are frenzied and attack, Ice Trolls flee into the Sea
- Maccath will leave regardless
- Ice Hunters are jubilant; Bonecarver presents Hagar with something special (see below)
- Ice Toads mourn, but could be willing to let gang transport their work
#### Bonecarver's Boon / Magnar's Claw
- Bonecarver fills her hut with incense and uses Hagar's totem to call the spirit of Magnar
- She places a bone needle in his skin in the chosen place for the tattoo and then conducts ceremony; ink spills into his skin magically and it consumes an attunement slot
- While attuned, your unarmed strikes are considered magical and you get +1 to attack and damage with unarmed strikes.
- As a bonus action, you can use your totem to empower the tattoo for 1 minute once per day. For the duration, all melee attacks or unarmed strikes can hit targets up to 15 feet away from you and deal an extra 1d6 force damage on a hit.
### Arauthator flees
- Ice Trolls and Kobolds are wary and stay away but remain in the lair
- Arauthator leaves for another lair to recuperate for some weeks with his mate
- Maccath is willing to leave if they go now
- Ice Hunters believe they have enough time to scatter and find a new home
- When they leave, they see his shadow in the far distance, watching them
- Ice Toads prefer to stay and continue their work
## Treasure
- Things have to be hacked out of the ice, and the bag of holding is full.
- Characters get to roll on the CR 11-16 hoard table once if they want to take things.
- Alternatively, if they aren't taking the Brotherhood material, they can take more treasure. But, Maccath will refuse to leave.
## Leaving
- Johnny and Rikbo are at the central food shaft and can haul people up
- If they instead go back up to the Scriptorium, it's an athletics check
- _Frostskimmr_ is moored at the shelf of bones
- Everyone levels up after the end of the session
