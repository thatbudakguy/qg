# Scenes
## Yawning Portal
### Intro
The gang have just transformed themselves into their sexy versions. Someone will play Calcey for this scene.

### Traps
- there is a dwarvish Zhent sentry named Gunnvor who has been ordered to watch the door to the room. If anyone attempts entry, Gunnvor has been instructed to notify a sorcerer named  who will contact the DRs.
- there is a _Glyph_ spell set on the chest, which inflicts the "Pain" effect (CON save or be incapacitated by pain). it glows when anyone other than Davil opens the chest, and is in effect for 10 minutes (anywhere in the room triggers it). you need to save every round. CON save DC 17.
### Treasures
- a manuscript called _Gods of Nature in the Realms_ by Sigrunn Garkalan of Neverwinter. A chapter dealing with Eldath, the Mother Guardian of Groves, has been marked up. The reader circled descriptions of Eldathyn holy sites: ponds, streams, waterfalls, springs, etc. One note says "peaceful waterfall city?"
- a handwritten note that says "D — can't find anything worth shit on this 'Vrandak the Burnished'. Might have been a decent general, but he obviously wasn't much of a lich. Tell Istrid to get off my ass about the cold-weather gear. S"
- inside the chest is a _programmed illusion_ cube like the one from Gensor's lab, with instructions from him on how to program and send back the other one.
- inside a chest is a _Potion of Mind Reading_, _Potion of Healing_, _Potion of Poison_

## The Halls of Justice
> The **Halls of Justice** are a temple of [The Triad](https://waterdeep.fandom.com/wiki/The_Triad "The Triad") (Tyr, [Ilmater](https://waterdeep.fandom.com/wiki/Ilmater "Ilmater"), and Torm) in the [Castle Ward](https://waterdeep.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Ward "Castle Ward") of [Waterdeep](https://waterdeep.fandom.com/wiki/Waterdeep "Waterdeep").

> [!QUESTION] 

Ontharr's stuff:
- The cult has taken a huge swath of territory spanning hundreds of miles around the Well. They raid the roads, etc. with impunity. They have exhausted livestock for miles around and are actively ranging south across the Sunset Mountains. Leosin and Sirge were recalled to Berdusk due to the encroaching threat.
- Dragons are actively patrolling multiple miles out from the Well. Scout patrols were met with swift resistance. One of the patrols Ontharr went out with was attacked, and he was one of the few survivors.
- Can Peregrine pray to the dragon gods for assistance? Can he get the attention of Faerun's good dragons? Some of the men are of the opinion that while dragons patrol the Well, there's no hope for an army of any size to penetrate their defenses. And the council still doesn't believe that any kind of frontal assault is justified.

## Jaeger's House
setup: a courier comes to Roarke House and notifies Peregrine that he is to inherit the goods and property of Jaeger Braun

- describe the simple house
- on the table, a letter written addressed to peregrine. it has a _glyph of warding_; when read the glyph triggers a fifth-level _fireball_
- building begins burning and collapsing; collapses in three rounds
- an ambush by Cult assassins led by Varick (tall, redheaded illuskan guy with a long scar that goes up and splits his hair)
