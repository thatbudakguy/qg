> what would your character's DJ name be?

# entering the sunglade

- Declan recognizes that a Mythal protects this place
- Hagar can feel Magnar's rage. The blight seethes on his arm as his own blood boils
- Hagar has a strong vision from Magnar of taking the crystal and walking into the tree
- **You are facing a clear choice. Do you do what Magnar is asking of you?**

## asking to heal Hagar's blight / rejecting Magnar

[turn off repeat/shuffle play here]

- **kaval sviri** plays as the Chorus sings a spell to quiet Hagar's anger
- the blight, and the tattoo itself, are stripped away in smokey ribbons
  - outside the Sunglade, huge streams of blight lift off from the ground and seem to twist into the sky like streaming smoke, towards the tree
- Hagar can feel Magnar's rage quiet, and his presence ebb from the world.
  - a great peace comes over you, peace like an ocean, peace like you have never known
- Hagar's totem snaps and falls to the ground from his neck.

[major part]

Archcantor Theneras realizes that the Sleeper's presence is gone. The Chorus rejoices. 
Rillifane's tree spontaneously blooms
Play **The Sea of Sorrows**  on Tragedy playlist.
So ends the long story of the first bear.  [end cadence]

[take a break]

## walking into the tree / accepting Magnar

play **The Fifth Chamber** on Tragedy playlist here.

If you approach inside the second circle of Menhirs, you enter the mythal that keeps Magnar asleep, the Hibernium. It is a deep, cold winter. The branches of the great tree above are bare. Magnar sleeps inside a den in the rocks, deep under the roots of Rillifane, with long, great breaths. He is a great bear the size of a house, with deer-like antlers.

When you rouse Magnar from his slumber, roll +WIS.

- On a 10+, Magnar returns to his former glory and regards you as a trusted ally.
- On a 7-9, Magnar is weakened and confused, immobile for a time but grateful for your assistance.
- On a 6-, Magnar is overwhelmed with hunger and rage, lashing out randomly with terrifying force.

- Hagar controls Magnar in battle
- Magnar does not participate in battle; Chorus attempts to re-imprison him
- DM controls Magnar; moves in a random direction (d8), attacks randomly determined creature in range or move to max range if not

HAGAR COUNTS AS THE THIRD SHARD FOR PURPOSES OF THIS

release Magnar:
- play **carmina burana**
- the illusion fades, leaving Magnar stirring and a low rumble echoes through the sunglade
- magnar's eyes open
- Archcantor Theneras: "Treachery! The Sleeper Wakes! Cantors, Seize the Crystal! Chorus, To ME!"
