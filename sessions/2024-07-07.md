# warmup

it's the final battle montage. what do we see your character doing?

# recap

- walking through deep woods, declan/araevin/ilsevele are harrassed by pixies. ilsevele is frustrated when her imperious nature is unable to sway the fey, but declan manages to convince them by picking the ringleader and squeezing him until he relented.
- inside the summer palace, calcey enters what looks like an air duct and is nearly flattened by a mithril automaton that has rolled up into a ball and is flying through the chute en route to somewhere else.
- on the drafting table in the study, the gang find architectural plans with a page ripped out suggesting that the observation dome at the top of the palace may offer a way down to the mysterious chamber at the bottom.
- ascending to the dome of stars, the gang find a large hovering marble throne and another body, dead for a long time, resting on the floor near it. On the body is a strange magical longbow that thrums with power and whispers elvish words into Hagar's ear when he draws it back, asking who has angered its lover.
- reaching the Cenotaph of the Crusader in Corellon's grove, Ilsevele stops to pray to her father and the seldarine for guidance. in an anticlimactic moment, she admits that she has never felt or heard the presence of Corellon in her life, a fact that gives her severe impostor syndrome because the Elven god apparently spoke directly with her father frequently.
- acting on impulse, araevin decides to see if he can open a conduit with a different god. with declan's permission, he asks ilsevele to step back to a safe distance and takes away declan's arcane focus, forcing the young sorcerer to contend with a rapidly-developing headache that soon puts him in severe pain and ejects arcane fire from his body. when declan says it feels like there is a splinter in his mind, araevin urges him to hold on and "pull it all the way out". declan blacks out.
- after fiddling with the controls hidden in the arms of the throne in the dome of stars, the gang trigger a brief but pitched battle with automatons that arrive through holes in the floor, all while Calcey continues to pitch the palace left and right in an attempt to open a passage downward. finally, a hidden spiral staircase around the edge of the dome lowers into the floor, and the gang scramble down it after the last of the automatons.
- at the bottom of the palace, Calcey emerges into the secret chamber, where someone has been waiting for her: A hulking automaton driven by a humanoid brain, four-armed and muscular, its white-hot core pierced by a strange sword made of jagged black iron. Giullio Moonflower lives, and he is not ready to let a wayward band of adventurers interfere with the plans he has taken years to perfect.

# outline

## summer palace

Giullio stats

- as Iron Golem, but gets four Slam attacks.
- while the Crownblade is in its furnace, retains immunity traits.
- if the Crownblade is removed, loses immunity traits, and the Palace loses power and begins to sink (dead man switch)
- once crownblade has been removed, brain is vulnerable to psychic damage or control spells
- crownblade can be used to re-power the palace if you get it up to the throne
- weapon is unfinished and cannot be fired or used. clockwork spellbomb cannon.

Crownblade stats

- +4 Holy Keen Longsword, overwhelming evocation aura
- glows with golden light that crackles along its surface
- Age half as fast while attuned
- three high mages in gems on crossguards and pommel: Lorak, Zereni (f.), Sixfingers
- you have +5 to all INT skill checks while wielding
- you have +10 to Arcana while wielding
- cast _heal_ 3/day, _detect thoughts_ at will
- bladerite: must be LG, good of elven people and elven empire as _highest_ priority. high CHA skills.
- fail: consumed by golden fire: as _disintegrate_, DC 23 CON save -> 40d6 damage and lose 1 level instead.

## demiplane of karsus

- an endless plain of black glass, shards crunching underfoot, strange towers and structures in the distance, lit by a gigantic red moon
- in spellsight, the weave is woven from a different material here, like black glass
- any spell you know can be cast here by simply thinking it, no components needed or spell slot necessary
- was once a beautiful world of sand and great structures, constructed by karsus in partnership with mystra, until his final spell ruined everything
- mystra is "imprisoned" here (magic still works) by szass tam while he searches out and collects chosen
- laeral silverhand is here (because she's asleep?), in powerful mage form, but has never penetrated szass tam's defenses
- roamed by thaalud ghouls: 12-foot-tall dark-skinned horrors with no head (just a textured bump) and a yawning maw of teeth at their distended "belly" carrying huge hammers
- https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/f/f6/Tomb_tapper-5e.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200917214218

### talking with laeral

- she has been visiting this place in her dreams, off and on, for almost 20 years
- mystra used to speak directly to her, years ago, but no longer does
- she thinks Declan is part of the dream, but she can't change him?
- advice: don't try to fly or become invisible. they're resistant to magic, but simple weapons and strategies sometimes work best.

### szass tam's domain

play "playpen" from it follows

- guarded by thaalud ghouls
- huge palace of black glass where the doors are all inscribed by netherese symbols
- two ways to go: either
  - strong necromantic magic aura (feels cold, like the opposite of a massive fire) + humming sound or 
  - prison chamber (threads of weave all move along palace like pipes/ductwork in this direction)

### prison chamber

play "lakeward" from it follows when Mystra is awoken

- mystra is held here in suspended animation. she is about 30ft tall
- she can be freed simply by disconnecting the weave; once done so she wakes up and realizes they have minutes until szass tam arrives (it is difficult for him to enter this place)
- she identifies declan as her chosen ("it worked!") and asks where elminster is, laeral says she doesn't know ("so few of you...")

### phylactery chamber

play "detritus" from it follows when room is entered
play "icewind dale 2 main theme" when they start coming
play "a moment of focus" looped after the phylactery is destroyed while they talk
3x checks to direct them into the phylactery (or however declan chooses to do it), increasing in difficulty

- ambient humming sound, like a huge machine
- powerful chill emanating from the obelisk, about 100 feet tall
- powerful necromantic magic aura; as sphere of annihilation
- laeral: "don't touch it"
- mystra takes them here and asks them to destroy it, since she has little power here
- once it is destroyed, she will tell one of the rival tharchions that he has been deposed, they'll move ot crush him
- laeral's plan, if declan has none: lure as many thaaluds as possible into the room and push them into it, causing it to overload
- if they fail, laeral steps in herself, going to be "wherever khelben is"
