## Calling home
- what did harper scouts discover at the well of dragons
	- Sirge and Leosin returned to Twilight Hall in Berdusk and summoned Harper spies from the area, who confirmed that the Cult is more entrenched than was previously thought. Chromatic dragons have answered the call of the _Draakhorn_, and have been raiding the towns along the Dusk Road with impunity. Some patrol the Well of Dragons night and day, making approach impossible. Well-armed mercenaries and Cult detachments have been seen traveling to and from the Well of Dragons from outlying areas along the Dusk Road.
- what did gauntlet/flaming fist forces do with this information after mustering at Elturgard
	- Marshall Ulder Ravengard of Baldur's Gate and Vindicator Ontharr Frume of the Order of the Gauntlet both led companies to Elturel, and have set out to liberate and reconstruct the Caravan City of Scornubel, which was razed by the Cult in a dragon attack. They will not press on to the Well of Dragons, but will report their findings to the Council.
