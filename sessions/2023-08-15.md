# Notes
## Encounters
### Leaving the Laboratory
- force of cloaks and city watch appear
- titus can get them out? maybe?
- what it looks like from the outside
## Locations
### Gensor's Laboratory
Arcane laboratory with dimensional pockets, bursting at the seams

**Motivation**: Portray the corruption and undoing of Mulmaster
**Sensory details**: Rapid and uncomfortable changes in air pressure, groaning metal and scraping stone, acrid smell of smoke
**At the table**: "Detritus", from _It Follows_, on a loop

Each player has the option to expose themself to danger in order to snatch something of value from the rapidly destructuring room. You roll 2d6

Available options:
- The _Sword of Selfaril_
- The _Gatekeeper's Crystal_
- Grappleshot heavy crossbow
- An iron cube with Gensor's sigil (inverse of Denlor's) with _programmed illusion_ with a message from Davil Starsong where he accepts Gensor's task to look for a shard of the crystal in the Tortured Lands
- Glass tubes with brass end caps containing various sizes of gems, labeled according to the souls supposed to be stored therein, e.g. "arson", "perjury", "murder", "robbery". The magic left these almost immediately; common souls won't work unless a _Soultheft_ is done "fresh".
- A great topaz the size of a deck of cards, labeled with the name "C. Sunhearth". It radiates magic.
- Twine-bound collection of letters written in a cypher and bearing Gensor's seal and two other mage's seals. Details the plot to depose Anivar Daoran of Phlan and the Brotherhood mage dispatched to do this, as well as one final entry from another mage instructed to assassinate the first.

### The Key of Memory
declan has a dream where he is in his bed back at the cult, drifting off to sleep, smell of peat smoke. an elven girl is standing above him. her arms are outstretched to show ornate silver manacles on her wrists. but as you watch she carefully unlocks each one using a small silver key, a radiant smile on her face. she looks down at him and smiles, presses the key into his hand. kisses the hand. she leaves the room. somehow, her leaving fills him with great sadness, as if losing a dear friend.

- **Motivation**: Provide a refuge in memory from the sorrows of the world
- **Sensory details**: The smell of wood smoke, far-off laughter of children, gentle wind in leaves
- **At the table**: "Starwood Choker"

the room is eryn's former home in the Elven Court of Cormanthor, as it appeared during her childhood almost 200 years ago. it is high up in a shadowtop tree. through the windows can be seen scenes of domestic life in the Elven Court: children playing, lovers reclining on the forest floor, people coming and going (ask Declan to describe what he sees). the room has a four-poster bed made from shadowtop wood with curtains.
## NPCs
### Selfaril Coldshore
Former High Blade of Mulmaster, imprisoned in the _Sword of Selfaril_

**Motivation**: Reclaim his rightful title as High Blade
**Sensory details**: The sense that a stronger hand than yours grips the blade, the smell of old leather and sweat, a wild sensation of freedom
**At the table**: Profanity-laced, bitter rants interspersed with a desire for a drink

The _Sword of Selfaril_ is an ornate longsword that functions as a +2 Longsword while Selfaril's soulgem is installed in pommel. Selfaril is joined telepathically to the wielder, and speaks directly to them when they are wielding the sword (no attunement needed).

Selfaril can be freed via a 9th-level _dispel magic_ or if the condition of his imprisonment is lifted:
