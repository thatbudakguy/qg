# Scenes
## Past the Blockade
- everyone on the brig seems to have gone down with the ship.
- what's your plan for getting into the harbor?
- customs inspection once docked. a few city watch plus one or two soldiers. ask if you have any to declare:
	- "humanoid cargo"
	- magical items with value exceeding 50 gold pieces
	- precious metals with value exceeding 50 gold pieces
- with a stealth check or other maneuvers that beats the two ships on either side of the blockade's checks, you can enter.
## Entering the City
- see the lighthouse at the edge of the docks
- thayan merchants directing slaves and undead unloading items from ships
- slave gangs being walked around in chains. slaves are not allowed to cut their hair
- probably notice the _Lady Dmitra_ because she's twice the size of any ship in the harbor and built with imported Thayan Blackwood. Two mainsails have the Mulman Wyvern and the Thayan Sunburst.
## Rusty Chock
- Benkin recognizes Calcey because she went back to the bar after what happened to her. He thought she had died because she was gone so long.
- Benkin orders everyone out of the bar for a "special event" so that calcey and the Gang can speak in private. When a guy is mad that he "ain't finished his game" of dice, Benkin loads his heavy crossbow. "'eye said oot.'"
- What benkin knows:
	- Thurndan has not been seeking the public eye, but Benkin is reasonably certain he's still in the city. Some of the longshoremen who resupplied the _Lady Dmitra_ have told him of a red-haired Cloak who seems to order people about on deck.
	- Benkin has kept prying eyes away from the entrance to Calcey's hideout, but he has no idea if it's still safe. There are whispers that anyone using the sewers these days doesn't always make it back to the surface. Somehow it seems less safe than the streets.
	- Thay joining the Moonsea League has brought great wealth to the city. Lots of items are a lot easier to get now, including some magical items and trinkets. Benkin refuses business to any Thayan sailors trying to enter the bar, however.
	- Many of the less savory elements that Calcey used to hang around with are no longer operating. The Watch, the Soldiery, and the Cloaks seem to be far better coordinated now, and some people just don't come back from Southroad. Plus there's this guy the Iron Tiger...
	- Benkin has seen The Finger recently, and he hasn't been looking so good. He asked to buy bottles direct from the bar, which you know Benkin only does for friends, but he had to refuse. Benkin thinks The Finger has been behaving strangely, and that he needs checking up on. 
## Calcey's Hideout
- Distinctive Troglodyte stench lingers here, and also the symbol of the Hangmen crudely etched somewhere. Eyes are painted all over it.
