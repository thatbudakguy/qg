# Outline
## Bang
> As the strange, tattered shape phases through the wall in front of you, insane mutterings and whispers seem to penetrate your very head, reaching a crescendo as the thing's dully burning eyes fix themselves on yours. The surprise is punctuated by the clanging and screeching of rusted metal from both sides of the room, as ancient suits of armor wielding rusted swords clatter to life, emerging from the broken staircases on either side of the altar. Roll initiative!
## Battle
- Three Mercenary Shadows emerge from each side of the basement, but Jaxyn doesn't seem to be aware of or controlling them. They fight dumbly until Savenna appears.
- Jaxyn uses his *Howling Babble* initially and then *Whispers of Madness* every other turn, targeting characters with the least wisdom. He tries to stay out of combat and phases through walls if necessary.
	- "Let me show you the other side of the world!"
	- "Everything is woven together, we are but threads fraying and fraying and fraying!"
	- "All the sages are liars! Material exists only in the mind!"
- On the fourth turn of the battle, Savenna appears, screeching about intruders and ordering the Shadows to target the youngest and most beautiful of the party, using *Life Drain* on them herself.
## Exploring the Castle
see [Castle Atuke](../locations/phlan/castle-atuke.md). Once the battle is over, everyone needs to make an INT save to avoid being affected by madness.
## Lord Sage
Very freaked out, very paranoid, hard to understand.

- thought someone was following him when he left Mantor's Library to buy scrolls and ink. certain that he was followed when he left Phlan, even outside the city!
- felt as though he had been scryed upon recently, itching sensation
- someone had moved papers around in his study, but he couldn't prove it, and Cassra denied it
- heard that the Mulmasterite navy was out in force in the East, along with members of the Brotherhood of the Cloak
- asked Cassra to do research on this "tallwand" guy, and...lo and behold...he produces a portrait he drew of the two brothers over a hundred years ago. Dead ringer for Tallwand. "Now you know everything...". Araevin figures it out if the PCs don't: this is Ranthor, former lover of Denlor.
see [moonsea-brothers-timeline](../notes/moonsea-brothers-timeline.md)
- went here because he knew that its defenses were exceedingly dangerous for mages and people susceptible to magical want of magical knowledge
- crafted a headband that hides the fact that he has a soul, making him effectively uninteresting to the undead that inhabit the castle. to Jaxyn, he simply feeds arcane knowledge bit by bit, keeping him at bay (hence the books). Araevin is intensely interested in the band.
## Ellison Berenger
Terrified, apologetic. NJ accent??

- will give the gang 100% since they saved his life before, and this makes twice.
- as soon as Aya recognizes him as "Sam", his fake name when he was her "student", she slaps him across the face.
- had been laying low at Zhentil keep looking for work, when he got waylaid in a back alley by a bunch of people in cult uniform. A half-elf in white armor told him that he'd be executed the same way as spernik and tibeem if he didn't do one last job for the cult. "just when i thought i was out...they pull me back in." She had a dragon with her! What was I supposed to do?
- "you remember when i got beaten half to death trying to get those scrolls out of Mantor's Library? yeah...turns out they wanted one more job like that. and nobody in the Moonsea could do it but me. She was right about that part."
- "see, before poor old Spernik got the rope, apparently he blabbed to some of those rotten Black Fists down in the Stojanow Gate prison. This lady said Spernik had it figured pretty good that something real important was in the Old Man's office in Mantor's Library. All I had to do was figure out when the hell he ever left so we had time to go in and get it."
