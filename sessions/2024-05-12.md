# Warmup
- Suggest a minor complication (something you would complain about) for another character.
# Recap
- Received a message from Araevin to meet in the city of Silverymoon, in order to access a portal to Evermeet.
- Otaaryliakkarnos takes the party to Silverymoon; Wiley stays behind with the Harper cell there.
- The party meets Araevin in the academy of magic in Silverymoon, where Taern Hornblade is also present.
- Araevin explains that the portal to Evermeet is in the Moonwood, and that the area is claimed by the People of the Black Blood, a loose society of lycanthropes.
- In the Moonwood, Hagar leaves a clearly visible trail for the lycanthropes to follow. We hear wolves howling in the distance.
- The party is ambushed by a group of lycanthropes led by Bloodmaster Heskret, who demand some be left as tribute to replenish the numbers of their clans.
- Araevin banishes the Bloodmaster and the party fend off the lycanthrope attack, but Calcey is bitten by a wererat and contracts lycanthropy.
- The beautiful female werebear Vakennis witnesses Hagar brutally finish off a werewolf and treats him with scorn.
- 19 days remain until Tiamat's return.
# Scenes
## House of Cedars
- you hear the sound of the ocean, and smell cool salt air and the scent of pine. the sun is warm on your face, and you feel a gentle breeze.
- a large, rustic lodge built of cedar logs, with a waterfall running through the center of it.
- araevin explains that the lodge is his ancestral home, now unused, and that it has portals around it that allow entrance from some places on the Mainland.
- araevin explains that teleportation magic does not function on Evermeet because it was created as a result of a mythal. they will need to either travel on horseback, or work something else out.
## Leuthilspar
- the capital city of Evermeet, built out of buildings "grown" from raw materials via magic and embedded with gems.
- eagle riders patrol the skies, and will find the party once they get within visible distance of the city. Araevin will need to convince them to let the party in.
- Araevin explains that the eagle riders come from Nimlith and are elite warriors.
## Hall of the Ancients
- a large building with a commanding view atop a ridge above the city, looking out into the bay.
- hundreds of noble elves will have gathered, including several matriarchs and their retinues of knights and spellarchers.
### Emardin Elsydar
- the foreigners should surrender their weapons.
- the elves would do well to remember Corellon's Vow. if aid is required, it should be given freely.
- the party should be allowed to speak with the Coronal, but they will be watched.
### Selsharra Durothil
- untold numbers of knights and spellarchers perished in Seiveril's Crusade. Evermeet is not so eager to lose its sons and daughters again.
- the Coronal is not her father. she is a fine ruler in peacetime, but she is not a warrior.
- the party should be treated with respect, as a show of generosity, but they ought not overstay their welcome.
### Ammisyll Veldann
(she speaks through a translator)
- the Coronal still holds too much power. Evermeet should no longer be governed by a single woman.
- the blood of orcs and dragons is not welcome in Evermeet. the halfling can stay, provided she proves civil.
### Breithel Olithir
- The cult of the dragon has made a grave mistake attempting to use mythal magic. It will backfire and destroy them.
- The Red Wizards of Thay have abandoned their cult allies, making the Cult less of a threat than others suppose. They are not a true threat to Evermeet.
- Araevin has spent too long on the Continent.
## Ilsevele's plan
