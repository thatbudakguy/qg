# Scenes
## Southroad Keep
- Southroad Keep, Mulmaster's oldest building, is the heart of its bureaucracy, serving as the headquarters for the City Watch and tax collectors, as well as the site for Mulmaster's courts and prison.
- The squat, circular brick building serves as the constabulary headquarters, information center, tax-collection center, visitor's registration, courthouse, and prison.
- The building is nearly always crowded, and lines are long and slow. The inner chambers are constantly choked with throngs of people waiting to conduct business with the city, and the overworked officials are never in a great hurry to keep the lines moving. There are also prisoners and foreigners registering with the city, and heavily armored wagons carrying money into the tax collection/mint area.
- The prison lies underground and has approximately the same area as the aboveground portion. The gatehouse can seal off the city's south gate in the event of a siege. One hundred soldiers are posted here at all times, though the keep can house as many as six hundred when necessary.
- super old fieldstone from the Earthspur mountains, noticeably older and simpler than other towers. just a giant circular building
- HQ for city watch and tax collectors, courts, prison.
- Crowded, with long and slow lines.
- dungeons: prison
- first floor: courts, registration of visitors (e.g. magic users)
- second floor: city watch and military offices.
- top floors: tax collector offices.
- 100 soldiers
### Clues
- governmental offices on the second floor have documents that detail sending prisoners to the tower of arcane might "special prisoner diversion program"
- records here of the apprehension of the Hangmen, including Huru Cuttlescar, and the fact that someone intervened in their case and took special charge of it (Huru was send to the tower, but the rest were released mysteriously)
- also records here that are copies of harbormaster's records indicating both the arrival of the lenses and the shipment of thayan magical items, earmarked as special magical cargo for thurndan
- the lenses taken in the heist are stored on the top floor in the tax collector offices in a safe; they are earmarked for groshin to later come and take, but he hasn't come back to do it yet
	- the safe has a spell on it that will silently alert groshin if it is successfully opened
