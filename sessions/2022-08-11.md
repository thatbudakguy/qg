# Outline
## Bang
Did you go back to the Leaky Bucket?
> You wake to the sound of rain on the roof of the Leaky Bucket. Calcey, you notice a small trickle of water that has made its way through the thatched roof and into your room, pooling on the ground. Your investments are clearly going to make a difference here...and perhaps help the Leaky Bucket prepare for a name change.
## Castle Atuke
see [Castle Atuke](../locations/phlan/castle-atuke.md).
### Skill Challenge
Objective: find the Lord Sage. Overall, the check will depend on what they're doing, but it'll be a group check (likely investigation).
- 3/5 fill up the difficulty meter (DC 19).
- Three on indiscretion. Sneaking around inside the castle is difficult, especially in broad daylight. You'll be noticed.
- Two on affliction. Something is off about the aura of the castle...just being close to it makes you feel like you're going a little insane.
- One on injury. The castle is falling apart, and it's dangerous to go to the upper floors.
- One on delay. It takes a long time to search an entire castle.
Total difficulty bumps: 15. For 6 players, that's a possibility of removing up to 12 prior to making the check.
