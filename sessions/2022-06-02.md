# Outline
## Bang
> [!INFO] Play "Hunter's Requiem" here.

> As the protective spell encasing the Mythal Stone fades away, Mithriel slumps to the ground. Araevin's demeanor softens somewhat as he helps the student to her feet: "Come on, up you come. Night's not finished yet. We need to get to the College."

- Hagar is still in love with Calcey.
- Mithriel is basically catatonic.
- Araevin leads everyone up to the surface to check on the College. Alyn is there and reports on the attack. 
- Araevin tells the Gang to get some rest at the Unicorn and Crescent and sends Mithriel with them. 
- He leaves with ominous words that he needs to speak with the High Huntress.
## Unicorn and Crescent
- Some of the students who evacuated the College fled here, and they're overjoyed to see Mithriel.
- Mithriel promptly goes to her room without speaking to anyone.
## College of Magic
- A dragon got up here, and it started to assault the academy, but it left after the Mythal reactivated. It did not stay long, but it was clearly looking for something and knew where to go.
- Alyn led the students into the Conservatory to shelter so that they were not harmed by the Dragon.
- People here can describe the Dragon (white, ridden by a Dwarf wearing a white mask and purple robes).
## Vine Vale
- Heavy damage to the tent city, but overall not a huge number of people died.
- Battle was mostly for control of Skyreach; when the soldiers realized that the dragons were coming for that, they sort of pulled back.
- Intel about Vorgansharax helped them keep him off the ground and fighting with the Feather Cavalry who were a better match.
- Dragonfire melted a hole into the iceberg and the dragons made off with what they could fit into the sack, and melted some other stuff, but some treasure was left.
## Contacts
- Anyone in Waterdeep (Leosin, Sirge, Renaer) will tell the Gang that their voices are needed in the City whenever they can spare the time. the Open Lord is gathering a council to deal with the threat of the Cult.
- Anyone in Phlan (Aya, Lord Sage) will tell the Gang that they are needed at home, since politically strange times seem to be on their way in the Moonsea (Aya's foreign students have withdrawn, blockade rumors, etc.)
## Hall of the High Hunt
Duirsar calls a council of the Hill Elders in the morning. Alyn is sent from the College to take the party to the council whenever they wake. When they arrive, there appears to be fierce debate between the nobility about whether the mask can stay, which Duirsar forcibly quiets.
### Task Force's report
- Duirsar asks the Task Force to speak first, if they wish to address the council.
### Archmage's report
- Alyn reports on the attack on the College of Magic (see above)
- Araevin reports that the mythal was disabled and that he, Mithriel, and Declan were able to reactivate it (unless the Task Force reported this already.) This causes some murmurs when Declan is mentioned.
### Tomb Master's report
- Trueshot reports on the losses in the vine vale and what happened (see above)
- He recommends that the Gang be honored for their bravery, and he lauds Araevin, whom he once regarded almost as a sort of coward.
### High Huntress's report
- Thia coldly reports on the fate of Laethan and Morian, the hunters who were abducted from the House of Cedars. Their remains were recovered, but they did not die in battle, nor did they die of their illness.
- When she explains that *soultheft* was performed, there is an audible gasp from many of the nobility/elves present. This ritual had not been cast in centuries, and the punishment is exile.
- Thia accuses Araevin of having taught Mithriel forbidden magic.
### The Mask
Duirsar opens the floor for people to speak about the Mask (in Common, or Elvish with a translator if necessary).
- Someone (a noble) probably says that the Gang need to go. Elves are respectful as a rule, but none of this would have happened if they had not arrived in the City in the first place.
- Trueshot speaks up in response to this about them having saved his life.
- Araevin wonders whether the Black Dragon Mask needs to be moved, as the Cult now know where it is. Araevin's idea is to cast *nondetection* on the Gang and have them move it to a safe place, if they know of one. The mask itself could be scryed on, but if it's in a dark and hidden location, this wouldn't reveal anything useful. They would have 8 hours to move the item before the spell deactivates.
### Next Steps
Duirsar inquires as to what the Gang plan to do.
