# Scenes
## The Ride
about 20 miles to Verdigris, which is most of a day's walk, but not difficult once you reach the valley floor.
2 days' hard riding on Rogan's Sprint to the foot of the Whitehorn.

**Moments**
- a herd of wild horses thunders past, with many-colored coats including stripes and cow spots
- a saber-toothed tiger stalking giant rams on the steep foothills of the mountains
- a vast expanse of wildflowers, small cotton-like blossoms drifting in the wind with a sweet smell

### Verdigris
A rough-around-the-edges town of miners and homesteaders with palisade walls. Pop: 250.

> [!QUESTION] What tells you that people here know how to fend for themselves?

#### Areas
- Old Verdigris: castle ruins once covered over by the glacier of the silver blades; revealed decades ago by its retreat. Collapsed mine entrances. Unsafe.
- Minotaur and Mermaid: the only "inn", with sawdust-covered floor and a simple sleeping loft upstairs with a few straw beds.
- Spring of Voices: a natural pool in the foothills outside Verdigris, avoided by miners but revered by the Varm people. _Kukka_ flowers grow here.
- Nomad village: yurts and cookfires, giant sheep, temporary horse market where Varm trade for metal tools and weapons with miners.
#### Discoveries
- Oswulf's Trail, which leads up into the foothills past Old Verdigris and to the Spring of Voices. Quite muddy and shunned by townsfolk.
- Radmo, a grizzled man with a soft heart who took to wife Kulun of the Varm long ago and speaks excellent Erakic. His daughter Sona is desperate to leave Verdigris.
- Legends say after a great storm the glacier seemed to grow with a mind of its own, centuries ago. But it has been in retreat longer than anyone can remember.
- In the Erakic language, the Tortured Land is known as "Lee Wai", the Land of Pain. Legends say that an ancient evil known as Tirantikus, the body-stealer, dwells there.
- _Kukka_ flowers grow around the Spring, which can be brewed into a tea or dried and smoked.
	- when brewed, the tea opens your mind to the presence of your ancestors, who can guide you with their memories.
		- https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Ancestral_Recall_(5e_Spell)
		- you gain a point of luck. when you spend this point, say how the voice of your ancestors guides your actions.
	- when smoked, the effect is much stronger, opening your mind up to extraplanar forces. you cast _Contact Other Plane_ as a ritual, requiring no components except the dried flower and a pipe.
		- Make a DC 15 INT saving throw.
		- On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speak only in gibberish. What words are you repeating over and over? (*Greater Restoration* ends this effect). 
		- On a success, you invite an extraplanar intelligence into your mind, receiving...?
		- If you have a totem, you have advantage on this saving throw, and you automatically contact the Primal Spirit matching your totem:
			- Bear: Magnar
			- Eagle: Remnis
			- Boar: Gorthok
			- Wolf: Amarok
			- Ram: Hirvi
#### Dangers
- Militia scouting parties, who are initially suspicious but placated when they see that the group are adventurers and Hagar is of Varm descent.
- Vaegould raiding party: 1 berserker and 1d6 + 1 tribal warriors, on horseback.
	- The Vaegould are warlike Erakic speakers who practice the ritual of Bloodfire, and venerate Varam of the Great Spear, actually a prince of Elemental Evil.
## Nomad Village
> [!QUESTION] (Hagar) What's the first thing you do when you get back?

After the PCs arrive, the village holds a feast in their honor. They prepare _Korkog_, which is a special stew made with potatoes and the meat of giant rams.

> The connection to the primal spirits, Ullo explains, predates even the arrival of the Eraka to the Ride. The oldest stories tell of a first age, where the people lived in a great forest that was warm and tangled, one filled with the energy that created the world, where trees grew to touch the sky. The primal spirits dwelt there, but a great cataclysm drove them from the forest, forcing the Eraka to flee and become nomads without their direct protection, forever wandering the realms. Since that time the spirits have spoken to their people only sporadically through the totems.

Legends (songs) that the Eraka know about Myth Ondath:
- After the arrival of the Eraka in the The Ride, there was a great battle far to the north, where the snow falls heavy in winter. Demons fought with angels in the bitter cold, led by a man with no skin. To end the war, the gods had to tear up the land itself and kill everyone. That place is cursed; no one has traveled there willingly in years (if asked, Dovydas was the last, 20 years ago). The land still echoes with the cries of the dead in the wind.
- Some say that the angels haunt that place still, and that when you are down to your last scraps of meat with no horse, they will appear to carry you off to the pure land of grass and water.

### Hagar's Playmate
- someone comes forward to guide the gang to the Tortured Land. This person was a former childhood acquaintance of Hagar, and is the only person other than Ullo who knows the truth about Hagar's _Meklejumi_. describe them:
	- is their rivalry bitter or friendly?
	- what made them the pride of the village, someone adults loved and other children looked up to?
	- Choose one for each:
		- Hard Eyes, Dead Eyes, or Eager Eyes
		- Wild Hair, Shorn Hair, or Braided Hair
		- Calloused Skin, Tanned Skin, or Scarred Skin
		- Built Body, Lithe Body, or Ravaged Body
	- what is their signature weapon? what is their totem? (see above)
	- pronouns & name
		- Temujin, Batu, Jochi, Hulagu, Chagatai

### A Dream
- the bloody hands massacring the ondonti. a one-eyed shaman wearing a fur coat with a necklace of human teeth. goblin servitors bearing the crystal and giving it to the shaman.
- uzgat's ritual: the GKC is laid on a fire. he sacrifices ilza. lightning comes down out of the constellation of the bear and strikes him dead. the remaining child is covered in blood.
## Whitehorn
The town has been totally destroyed by an attack by the Bloody Hand Orc tribe a few days prior. The Bloody Hand absorbed the remainder of the Burning Banner after Hagar killed Narle Shieldbiter several months ago â€“ some dead or dying may recognize the Shieldbiter Heirloom.
