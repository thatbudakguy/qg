# Scenes
## Scriptorium
- Entrance to this is via a large empty chamber, waiting to be filled with trophies but presently empty.
- An ice troll is guarding it, but can't be seen until you reach the top of the ramp.
- Maccath's shelter is made from huge tapestries and carpets draped across a frame of whale ribs, and stands 8 feet tall, 20 feet wide, and 30 feet long. The bottoms of the walls drape down onto the ground, leaving no gaps underneath.
- The interior of the shelter is surprisingly warm, thanks to a small stove and simple lamps burning aromatic whale oil. Carpets are heaped on the floor in thick layers, and tapestries from every culture in FaerÃ»n hang suspended from a sturdy frame of whale ribs.
- Books and scrolls are stacked neatly on tables and reading stands made of hide and whalebone. The only furnishings in the shelter not made from these natural materials are the carpets and tapestries, and a portable writing desk that appears to have been taken from a sailing ship.
- Maccath is seated at the writing desk wearing a crimson cloak over fancy tailored furs. She's wearing a silver and ivory brooch with the Arcane brotherhood symbol on it. She is surrounded by huge scrolls and seems to be writing something out intently. Two kobolds nervously attend her.
### Talking with maccath
- she sets terms for her rescue. too much work has been done here and too many things are in the lair to leave all of them. as much as possible has to come with them when they leave.

**how she got here**:
- hosttower of the arcane in luskan was pillaged during the last rage of dragons in 1373; many items were stolen at that time
- a Rage was a periodic event centuries ago, but it's not certain why they happened. Some blame the Elves for creating a *Mythal* that spanned all of Faerun, but this is disputed. Maccath's theory is that it was a corrupted version of a Giant spell cast long ago, tied to the King-Killer Star comet.
- anyway, Maccath figured out based on the Tower's own historical records and other sources (including from Candlekeep) that it was OWD who took a lot of these things, including the Draakhorn. So she sought him out in the Sea of Moving Ice.
- He killed or ate (or froze) all of her crew, but when he saw she had Arcane Brotherhood credentials, he got an idea. Arveiaturace, his mate, is a little loony because she used to have a wizard master who rode on her back. But she refuses to recognize that he died for a long time and is now grieving, still wearing the body. so, OWD is hoping to snap her out of it by giving her a new master (Maccath).
- He thought that this offer would sound good to her. She in reality didn't care, but figured she could bide her time to plan an escape. In the meantime, he has been having her translate the stolen materials, which she is only too happy to do and considers her life's work.

**what she knows**:
- OWD is currently in the lair, eating
- most of the things taken from the hosttower are in the scriptorium, but a few are prbably in the lair
- she has been down ot the lair but doesn't know it well; probably it has all sorts of nasty things going on.
- there's two ways in: the chute in the central area of the caves, and another smaller passageway in the scriptorium. OWD can clamber up and down both, but if you go down there, you aren't coming back up easily...he likes it that way.
- humans in dragon cult robes came to the iceberg five tendays ago. 
- she has a ring of cold resistance and two arrows of dragon slaying

### the items from the hosttower
Three shelves stand in this otherwise empty cavern, cobbled together out of salvaged wood, whale bone, pieces of giants' armor, and even the frozen limbs of yetis. A number of scrolls, books, parchments, and folios are carefully arranged on the shelves, all bearing the markings of magical writing.
