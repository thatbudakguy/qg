## Tower of Arcane Might
- courtyard = authorized vendors only who sell foods, etc. entrance door protected by golems. 10ft stone wall with ward atop it. vendors enter in morning and exit at night.
- dungeon = storehouse. literal gold is stored here, as well as magical items. trapped as fuck
- first floor = library. lots of forbidden magical tomes, etc. warded. tomes are chained to shelf.
- second floor = dormitories. gensor doesn't sleep anymore, so need to go here. basic kitchens but most people use the vendors.
- third floor = laboratories. high-ranking cloaks get their own, low-ranking work for high-ranking. gensor has his own at the top of the tower. extremely trapped.
- sigils of Cloaks grant access. when being admitted you inscribe your sigil on a magical plate that "teaches" it to the golems. plates stored in special part of library. carrying an item with the sigil then serves as a sort of passkey.
