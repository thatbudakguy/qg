# witchthorn's domain

## entering

- the nearest circle of standing stones has a strong fey presence (glowing mushrooms, rioting plants, etc.)
- the trees seem to have grown back with a vengeance, but have a strangely foreboding and dark character.
- an older woman in a green smock is "out foraging" ingredients for her stew (she has collected some rare mushrooms).
- she greats them as "dears" and invites them to come help with the stew
- if they try the stew, it has an elven child's hand in it, and anyone who tried it is sickened
- (creepily running her hands on peregrine's cloak) "what a wonderful elven cloak...THIEF."
- "i'm not here to repay your violence in kind...though I would be fully justified, since you dissolved the pact of the quivering forest. i'm just his messenger. i'm to be your guide. hmmm...who could it be? starts with a witch...ends with a thorn. i think he enjoys the hate we have for each other. that's why he brought me back."
- "this place was once enveloped by the feywild in a lover's embrace...it's riddled with holes like a delicious maggoty apple. your little trick with the sleeping bear-god seems to have brought the two planes back together again. it's a family reunion...and in the dark forested places, you can be sure he's there. they belong to him just as much as they do these tasty pale little elves."
- "i'm to take you to the shady glade. we won't be returning to this realm. the rest of you may come along, or not. his oath does not concern you, but try to be a hero and you will dig your friend's grave even deeper."
- if they won't accompany her, she informs them that witchthorn will consider the pact broken and will react accordingly. "not surprising, considering your past actions, but disgusting nonetheless. i hope he feeds you to old gnawbones."
- if they decide to accompany her, she guides them deeper into the forest, and the trees grow larger, and eventually displacer beasts are padding alongside them in the gloom.
- finally they come to a blank signpost, where Jeny scratches Witchthorn's name into the sign with a knife and leads them on into the shady glade.


## the oath

- in the shady glade, lit by twinkling purple fairy lights, witchthorn and some members of his retinue are dining on a freshly killed stag. a huge table consisting of a single, gargantuan slab of wood seats nearly twenty satyrs and dryads along with other strange human-animal hybrid forms, some of which are gnawing on hunks of meat. a crackling oak fire nearby roasts shanks from the beast and throws off sparks that sail up into the warm night air.
- also seated at the table are a wild-looking woman with spiral-like tattoos and a dark bar painted across her eyes, and a heavily muscled dark-skinned man with a similar bar painted in white across his face, wearing a necklace of animal teeth. both are wearing a few animal skins, but little else. the woman holds Hagar's eyes without blinking.
- witchthorn is slumped in a curved throne of ivy at the head of the table, his hand curled around a wine glass, looking bored. a displacer beast lays at his feet, its long whiplike tails wavying lazily.
- above the trees, the sky is visible for the first time in the journey. the moon is full: huge, round, and yellow. Calcey feels the urge to shift form.
- he asks the gang to come and dine with his retinue, seating Calcey at the head of the table nearest him. he whispers to her to indulge herself and to not hold back when eating, wishing her to transform. do you do it?
- witchthorn clinks his long nails on his silver goblet and offers a speech.

## speech

I have bid these mortals to come to my table to settle two debts. Unanswered blood has been spilled. Our honored guests from the Moonwood have suffered the loss of many of their kin, and The Hunt is poorer for their absence. The people of my court in the Shady Glade have always held an ear for the grievances of the People of the Black Blood, and this matter is no exception. It came to my attention that this situation was also an opportunity.

A moment or a lifetime ago, these mortals blundered into my domain seeking my assistance in another matter entirely. I was the one bearing a grievance then: against my one-time lover and perennial enemy, the great Green Wyrm of Kryptgarden, Claugilyamatar. In return for my help, I extracted an oath from one brave, foolish mortal: to do my bidding, at a future time of my choosing.

That time is now: time to put our grievances aside, one and all. The woman I see at my right hand is changed: a fearsome hunter with powerful sorcerers and dragons among her quarry, and black blood in her veins. Tonight she dines on venison in an unseelie court; tomorrow she marches to topple the Dragon Queen and liberate the mortal realms. I have seen all this and more in my reflecting pool.

And I too find myself changed: though my darling Ishaldra, the dryad I once called wife, is long lost to me, and the old green wyrm laughs in my face, there is still room in this bramble heart for love. (he kneels and conjures a tiny ring of thorns) Calcey, will you join with me in marriage? Tomorrow you may save the world, but tonight let us bind our hands in the traditional way. Then, return victorious to me as my companion.

## the ceremony
