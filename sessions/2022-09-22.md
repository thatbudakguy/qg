# Announcements
- i updated Harlequin in D&D beyond to be a shortsword so that Calcey could be proficient with it. We'll just say it's a curvy shortsword.
- trying a different narrative structure for this episode: hard framing with flashbacks. each character gets one flashback. you control the scene for your flashback. i'll provide you with some suggestions, but it's up to you how or if to use it. if you're not involved in a scene, your job is to be present and be a fan of the people who are.

**Flashback Options**

for each of these, at the opening we need to know:
- when is it happening?
- who is present?
- how does the scene open?

the GM ends the scene. note that they have to have taken place in between the end of the past session and the start of this one.

- *Research*: you looked up something at Mantor's Library or elsewhere that would give you clues about the hunting lodge, trolls, etc.
- *Items*: you bought something useful from Fillistrom's Apothecary, Vang's Armory, Valero's Blades, etc.
- *Planning*: you prepared something in advance, like setting a trap at the standing stones.

# Scenes
## Opening
> An icy wind blows through the forests of the Greypeak Mountains. On the bare ground in front of a run-down mansion, Talis the White stands in her shining plate armor, flanked by two heavily armored knights. A few paces behind, the dragon cultist Kusphia, her face masked in a strange twisting design, stands silently in her dark robes. On the ground at her feet is a huge, shining tower shield inlaid with runes and gems.

> [!QUESTION] What do you look like as this scene opens? What's going through your mind?

Talis orders Maelgot and Sorvic to carry the shield out to whoever is doing the exchange, then asks Kusphia to retrieve the Black Dragon Mask. The items are to be left on the ground in between everyone. She offers the shield first.
## Battle
> I'm happy to inform you that your service is at an end (she holds up a scraggly mess of hair and lets it blow into the wind). Glazhael! 
### Talis's strategy
- use her wand of winter at range; freeze people
