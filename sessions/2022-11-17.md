# Scenes
## Opening

- night is falling. will the party go on shore? wait on the ice to approach?
- Declan can see with his Spellsight that there is a haze of protective spells rapidly approaching (or make a check to notice this before they get inside range).
- Calcey can see the shelf where the Ice Hunters park their boats; it's full of bones.

## Arrival at the village
### Peregrine
- you recognize the illuskan warriors frozen in ice
- - Peregrine will notice that the Ice Hunters are super anxious about the dragon on his shield/his holy symbol
### Declan
- clearly people singling you out for being a sorcerer
### Hagar
- people are eyeing the totem, esp. bonecarver
### Calcey
- something's not right here. it feels like a setup
## Champion match
### Hagar
- you get the sense that Orcaheart is fighting out of desperation; this isn't a real contest of strength
### Calcey
- you get to be Hagar's coach again. might notice that Orcaheart is falling in front of Bonecarver
### Peregrine
- As the two are fighting, might notice someone slip away to the main hall
### Declan
- During the fight, might notice Bonecarver healing Orcaheart surreptitiously (if a high result)

## Audience with Bonecarver
**Bonecarver speaks to Hagar in druidic**.

She had She cast her seal bones and received a strong omen about Hagar.

- "Did the first bear send you?"
- 

## Questions

> [!QUESTION] Bonecarver does something that no one you've met since you left your tribe does, that makes you immediately think of home. What is it?
