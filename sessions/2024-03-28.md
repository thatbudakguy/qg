**roll a d10 for days lost while in memory.**

## Roarke House
- greengrass festivities are occurring in waterdeep. renaer is not at home; he has gone to procure flowers for his father to distribute to less wealthy waterdhavians as part of the festival. children are running through the streets throwing petals everywhere and laughing. some ladies are wearing fanciful hats with flower and leaf arrangements. there are processions of chauntea and other clergy in the streets.
## Council of Waterdeep
- order of gauntlet and flaming fist have been setting up resupply stations and forward camps outside well of dragons. emerald enclave and harpers spies have reported that well seems to be surrounded by some kind of magical aura. lord's alliance is calling for a military draft in sword coast cities, but many proposals were rejected by local governments.
- dwarvish delegation has resolved to take the field with the humans. king connerad has departed for citadel felbarr.
- araevin is in evereska. king melandrach has gone to evermeet to convince lady miritar to join.
## Metallic Dragons
- protanther 
## Evereska
- araevin's student mithriel volunteered to travel in disguise to observe the well of dragons. her spell provides Araevin's theurglass window a look at what the Cult is doing.
- it's now clear that the Cult managed to raise a mythal, and they did it using the souls of dying chromatic dragons.
- the cult is building a temple to Tiamat to guide her return from Avernus. at the rate they're going, they will be finished in 25 days, on the 20th of Kythorn.
- the hill elders are convinced of the danger, but some advocate bolstering evereska's own mythal instead and waiting out the destruction. if there was a plan to bring down the cult's mythal, and other elves joined in the action, evereska could be moved to join.
## Evermeet
