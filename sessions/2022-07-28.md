# Outline
## Bang
> Ali sighs with regret. "Sha'ir you may be, but sword dancers you are not. If you are going to use my sword, you should know how to do it without killing yourself. Now listen carefully."

Ali explains that Denlor called the sword by a different name, and it's probably in his "little book" in the other room somewhere.
## Phlan
### Denlor's tower
- Denlor's journal entries (ordered); all in Halruaan but can be deciphered by Cassra or others if paid for their time. Draconic numbers are decipherable so dates can be roughly guessed.
	- moving from halruaa to phlan (1333)
	- meeting ranthor, early relationship (1333-4)
	- gensor's exile and coming to phlan (1334)
	- suspicion that gensor too into dragons and is in too deep with xandria welltran, but then she dies suddenly (1335)
	- travel to the plane of fire and city of brass, acquiring harlequin, playing chess (1336)
	- suspicion that gensor is suddenly doing so much work for the cadorna family; unrest on council, binding Ali (1337)
	- noting that things seem to be getting quite bad re: lord of the ruins (1338-9)
- stats and other stuff for items in Denlor's chest/rack
	- A *wand of the war mage +1,*. Made of yew, with a design of curling flames carved into the lower half.
	- A *flame tongue* +1 short sword with a ruby ringed by a gold sunburst set in the hilt and a pattern of alternating diamonds etched into the blade. Its command word (and its name) is *Mutaghayir,* "harlequin" in the language of the Efreet.
	- A *ioun stone of awareness*
	- Three *potions of healing*
	- A *potion of fire breath*
	- A *potion of fire resistance*
## Kabel's Hill
- picking up aya, getting horses, and going there with araevin
- sun is getting lower as they get out to kabel's hill.
- if they go to leaky bucket, hupe and grinna talk about not getting anymore alcohol from hillsfar.
### The "Seagull's Caw"
- the crew has returned to their various current homes in Phlan or Kabel's Hill since the blockade made trade and sailing largely impossible. if contacted, Calvin can call the crew together in either location to meet
- Any of the crew of the Seagull's Caw can say that they haven't been able to get anywhere east of Melvaunt carrying textiles/wool for trade due to blockades. Thentia was closed off, and they heard the Mulmasterite navy is everywhere in the East.
- They got a small amount of money (the party's share is 20gp) selling the wool in Melvaunt, but not nearly as much as they'd hoped, and had to sell the rest back to the Cadornas at cost.
- On the docks, there are whispers that a great evil was recently perpetrated in Thentia. An arcane weapon of terrifying power was unleashed that destroyed the Watchlord's Tower. The next day, Thentia joined the Moonsea League.
