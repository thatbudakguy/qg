# Outline
## Bang
an attention-grabbing way to start the session off.
## Phlan
### Denlor's tower
- Denlor's journal?
- stats and other stuff for items in Denlor's chest/rack
	- A *wand of the war mage +1,*. Made of yew, with a design of curling flames carved into the lower half.
	- A *flame tongue* +1 short sword with a ruby ringed by a gold sunburst set in the hilt and a pattern of alternating diamonds etched into the blade. Its command word (and its name) is *Mutaghayir,* draconic for "harlequin".
	- A *ioun stone of awareness*
	- Three *potions of healing*
	- A *potion of fire breath*
	- A *potion of fire resistance*
### Mail
- Peregrine previously posed as "Tommy" to deliver mail for the Black Fist. He can collect mail and/or deliver it from the New Phlan Garrison on Huldane Way (O on the map).
- The Tears arranged for a coded letter to be sent out indicating that they believe the Lord Sage is a target who would know the location of the Scale. the response to this message, intended to be delivered to Fulta and also written in code, is waiting at the mail depot in the Black Fist garrison outside the East gate (where Peregrine formerly picked up mail). It can be deciphered to indicate that the Lord Sage is in imminent danger and that a prison break is planned.
### Stojanow Gate
- Aleyd knows that there was a big fight in the Stojanow Gate prison shortly after Spernik was executed. One of the inmates, a Grey Patriot highwayman named Markus Swiller, was stabbed by several of the former Tears of Virulence, though no weapon was recovered and nobody took responsibility for the crime. Aleyd suspects the Tears because they told different stories about what happened when questioned.
- Any of the Tears or Fulta can be flipped in exchange for shortening their sentence or perhaps money to reveal that Markus knew too much: he caught wind of the fact that the Tears were communicating with someone on the outside about some information they got from Spernik right before his execution.
- The PCs can actually _speak with dead_ the corpse of Spernik if it can be recovered; after the hanging it was publicly exhibited and then dumped outside the city gates. Aleyd would know where it is, but it's pretty decomposed.
## Kabel's Hill
- picking up aya, getting horses, and going there with araevin
- sun is getting lower as they get out to kabel's hill.
- if they go to leaky bucket, hupe and grinna talk about not getting anymore alcohol from hillsfar.
- when they see serelis, if they tell him everything, incl. lord sage's research, he thinks about it. asks if there were any identifying marks or noticeable items in view when scrying.
- if they scry again, the spells fails because the LS has cast nondetection.
- about research, serelis knows that all the previous rangers who held this job, back for centuries, would know. but they're dead, and this would be before Kabel's Hill ever even existed, so they would be buried in a place that is just inside the Quivering Forest now.
- Serelis can find the grave of Velene the ranger who was active at that time (mid-800s DR) and who remembers the Doom of Atuke...
	- The Atuke family was known to employ legions of mercenaries with copious coin and dominated early Moonsea politics
	- Baron Jaxyn Atuke was a known Alchemist who sought the Chrysopoeia, transmuting substances into Gold
	- A great forest spirit had spoken with the Baron of Atuke and granted him a wish for knowledge
	- But the knowledge was something he could not refuse, and it brought ruin on his mind and his house
### The "Seagull's Caw"
- the crew has returned to their various current homes in Phlan or Kabel's Hill since the blockade made trade and sailing largely impossible. if contacted, Calvin can call the crew together in either location to meet
- Any of the crew of the Seagull's Caw can say that they haven't been able to get anywhere east of Melvaunt carrying textiles/wool for trade due to blockades. Thentia was closed off, and they heard the Mulmasterite navy is everywhere in the East.
- They got a small amount of money (the party's share is 20gp) selling the wool in Melvaunt, but not nearly as much as they'd hoped, and had to sell the rest back to the Cadornas at cost.
- On the docks, there are whispers that a great evil was recently perpetrated in Thentia. An arcane weapon of terrifying power was unleashed that destroyed the Watchlord's Tower. The next day, Thentia joined the Moonsea League.
## Castle Atuke
- affected by a permanent AOE effect that imbues insanity for 1d10 hours if DC 16 INT save is failed: an insane creature can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish. The DM controls its movement, which is erratic. After time is elapsed the creature can save again if within range of the effect
- mind blank or other spells will protect fully; calm emotions can make people not move/chill out but they won't comprehend anything. this spell also works on the Allips (but not the Bodak).
- bodak (leader of house) and allips (members of house) are out at night but not in the day. bodak stays hidden
## Waterdeep
### Roarke House
- if the gang call ahead, Ren and Lara will be there to receive them. If not, nobody is in the den where the teleportation circle is located.
- Ren can tell them that he's in contact with Remi and is trying to get the Lord's Alliance into gear to convene a special war council at the Lord's Palace.
- So far, Lady Silverhand has indicated her tacit support. Marshall Ulder Ravengard of Baldur's Gate, head of the Flaming Fists, and Sir Isteval of Cormyr is also on board.
- Ren is still trying to get support from Silverymoon, representatives of the Elves, representatives of the Dwarves, and a commitment from the South (Amn, Tethyr, or Calimshan). And, unfortunately, he probably needs representation from Neverwinter...which means his dad, Dagult.
- If the PCs come forward and are willing to serve, it would go a long way towards bringing the other delegates in. Everyone will want to hear their story, at a minimum.
- Without the PCs, there's a strong risk that the council devolves into name-calling and petty grievances. Some of the members have beef with each other that's literally centuries old.
### Ulbrinter Villa
- House known for shipping and shipwrights. Crest is a ship on a green sea with a sail bearing a heart on it.
- Leosin and Sirge are here, off of Delzorin Street and Windborne Way. Leosin has been in contact with Ontharr, asking him to send an Order delegation to the council.
- If visited, the PCs can meet Remi, as well as the HAWKs (it's currently a somewhat full house). Also 24 guards and 6 servants.
- Nomus Ulbrinter is a former sea captain and patriarch of the house, although he left management of it to his son and daughter-in-law long ago. He mostly reads in his study.
- Leosin has suspicions about the ways the Cult is mounting its attacks: the Misty Forest, Evereska, etc. He asks the PCs to meet with him at night, in secret, with a contact who may know more (Dala Silmerhelve, a noble whose secret patron dragon Nymmurh gave her this information). 
### Yawning Portal
- Durnan recognizes Hagar, if the PCs desire, since he helped fend off the Troll. he may be willing to do a favor for the party if asked.
## The Cult
if scryed on, Talis seems to be assembling a force consisting of a Blue dragon, a half-dragon soldier, and some other cultists. she's also noticeably no longer at the well of dragons anymore and is in someplace more northern/moonsea-looking (where is cult base nearest Moonsea?)
