## Bang
> As you emerge from the dusty cellar of Serode's shop, you are temporarily blinded by the early spring sunlight of Evereska. It is midday on Ches 12, two days since the crash of Skyreach Castle. Among with the sounds of the forest and quiet elven voices of the neighborhood of Moondark Hill, another voice reaches your ears: "Declan, this is Archmage Teshurr. Could you stop by the College of Magic? There's a message waiting for you here." What do you do?
## College of Magic

- Araevin is chatting with Manynests in the courtyard when they arrive: "Yes, but I'm needed down in the Vale. I know, I don't like the Elders to be left without protection. These are dangerous times."
- Araevin introduces Manynests as Duirsar's messenger, and begins to convey the bird's message for the gang, until Manynests angrily stops him and delivers the "message" himself (Araevin translates): "Lord Duirsar, Watcher over the Hills, requests your presence at his Council at sundown at the Hall of the High Hunt."
- If asked, Araevin happily relinquishes Hazirawn, but inquires what they intend to do with it. Hazirawn shouts about its previous owner until silenced.
- When the PCs leave, as an afterthought, Araevin asks them to return something to Mithriel, since she left it at their last lesson. It's a book on Elven High Magic called _Mystery of Mythrien Sarath_. If read by someone speaking Elvish, the book describes the (false) belief that a deity called Mythrien Sarath helped to raise Mythals. Instead, it goes into detail about how many people were needed for this magic, describing rituals of Solitude, Complement, and Myriad.
## Serode's Shop
On meeting Hazirawn, Serode is excited to have "some company". But after he judges her thoughts to be "impure" and her body "frail", she puts the sword into a large drawer and closes it so that his voice is muffled again. "Better..."
## The Sensible Romantic
Artisan shop called "The Sensible Romantic" owned by Eneleth and Galebor, a couple (two men). Eneleth: overweight, dresses in a silk kimono-like garment, similar to Gilmore, works front of house, poet, collector of reject wines. Galebor: shredded, short hair, speaks in a curt manner, practical, works back of house, makes daggers and wind sculptures (and carves poem stelae for Eneleth). Far more willing to barter than they are to pay in coin, and may not have too many gold pieces with which to pay.

Most of what they want comes under the heading of pursuing hobbies, from collecting coins or weapons from places as far afield as Zakhara, to collecting magic. In exchange for items or equipment needed for the pursuit of his hobbies, they sell baubles: the tinkling blown glass and metal wind sculptures that hang in trees making soft music in the breezes from one end of the vale to the other; tiny ornamented, sapphire-adorned silver-bladed daggers that are much favored as hidden defenders among noble ladies all over Faer√ªn; vintages considered too poor for Evereskan tables; small poems set down in exquisite calligraphy on slabs of ivory or the like in delicate hanging frames; practice or rejected works of art such as paintings, statuettes, and carved boxes.

## Skyreach Wreck
- Trueshot or Rhaellen Darthammel know that Tyrael didn't return from his patrol on the night of Ches 10.
- Captain Darthammel knows that Tyrael was a veteran of the Tomb Guard, not some fresh soldier. He was an expert ranger and, as a Cavewalker, knew the Passage better than most, as he was responsible for teaching it to the Elves who were preparing to leave the city.
- Both men know that no patrols entered Skyreach on the night of Ches 10, as it wasn't deemed safe. Tyrael's route would have taken him around the perimeter of the castle.
- It's difficult as the tracks are muddy and well-worn, but a PC can potentially retrace Tyrael's steps. A DC 20 Survival check reveals a scuffle took place some days ago on the far side of the castle, where a medium Creature struggled for some time. Blood was lost here, but oddly, only one pair of footprints leaves this area in a different direction.
## Unicorn and Crescent
 - Students at the Unicorn and Crescent can describe seeing Tyrael enter the place late at night, looking for Mithriel. He left after a short conversation with her. Nothing seemed amiss.
- Mithriel's parents, who live near Moondark hill, haven't seen her in two tendays, as she's been busy with her stewardship and studies. She normally visits every few tendays.
- An investigation check reveals that Mithriel's room at the Unicorn and Crescent hasn't been touched since the night of Ches 12.
- In the room is a journal that reveals that about two years ago, Araevin brought Mithriel with him to a place called the Groaning Cave in order to test her in Elven High Magic (after years of practice with him). The trip seems to have been a mixed success.
## Hall of the High Hunt
- audience with the Elders re: contact from High Forest & Council being formed
