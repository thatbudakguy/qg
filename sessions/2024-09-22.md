- originally part of AW, part of PbtA lineage
- idea is that you fast-forward time if your character was out or a lot of time elapsed
- lets us keep the story moving, remind us what was happening when we left, and get an interesting choice
- "dear X...love and kisses, your GM"
- "roll +X" means "roll 2d6 and add this stat bonus or number"
- "miss" means 6 or less, "hit" means 7 or more. "10+" means "10 or more".
- these rolls aren't subject to inspiration, luck, etc. but you'll almost always get to make a choice.

> Dear Keeler, please roll+cool. On a 10+, choose 1. On a 7–9, choose 2:
> 
> • The headaches are getting seriously worse.
>
> • You’re missing time, sometimes hours out of a day, more and more.
>
> • You’ve been eating some really weird-ass stuff.
>
> On a miss, I’ll choose 2 for you. Love and kisses, your MC

## calcey

Dear Calcey,

The first full moon came quickly, didn't it? Secretly, you were excited to experience your first transition to your new rat form. When the Gang returned to Waterdeep before heading off in pursuit of the final shard of the Gatekeeper's Crystal, you got to experience the undercity from a whole new vantage point...on all fours.

Please roll +WIS. On a 10+, choose two. On a 7-9, choose one. On a miss, none, and someone on the council saw you transform – they're wary of you now.

- You stole something valuable while in rat-human hybrid form. What is it?
- You led a gang of actual rats into battle while in giant rat form. They'll remember you.
- You didn't end up spending the night in jail and paying a fine of 1d10x100 gp.

Love and kisses, your GM.

## declan

Dear Declan,

Tracking down the third shard wasn't easy, and the archives on Evermeet proved surprisingly light on information. You and Araevin had to get pretty creative to piece together all of the history, but you figured it out...eventually.

Please roll +INT. On a 10+, choose one. On a 7-9, choose two. On a miss, I'll choose two for you.

- You had to trade an uncommon or better magical item to the Arcane Brotherhood for a tome of lore
- You had to fork over 2d20x100 gp to the Zhentarim for a lead
- The location you got was out of date, setting you back an additional 1d4 days
- Someone got wind of your search for information and is on your tail

Love and kisses, your GM.

## peregrine

Dear Peregrine,

You returned to Waterdeep as the formal representative of Metallic Dragons for the final meeting of the Council, even though Zora made you promise never to come within the city limits again. She got back at you by arranging for a team of Cult of the Dragon suicide assassins to get access to the Council chambers.

Please roll +INT. On a 10+, choose one. On a 7-9, choose two. On a miss, all three.

- A member of the Council of Waterdeep was assassinated. Who?
- Zora got away unscathed. How?
- Wiley tried to warn you, but Zora got to him first. He's gone.

Love and kisses, your GM.

## hagar

Dear Hagar,

You've been feeling off for...a while now. Ever since you acquired that second shard of the Crystal, actually. It's getting to the point that you're worried someone else will notice.

Please roll +WIS. On a 10+, choose one. On a 7-9, you choose one and I'll choose one. On a miss, all three, and the gang definitely knows.

- Something is wrong with your tattoo. Oily ink is slowly spreading up and down your arm.
- Anytime you stop to rest, you get a strange urge to lay down to sleep, no matter where you are.
- Sometimes when you commune with nature, your head is instead filled with strange, ethereal singing.

Love and kisses, your GM.

# recap

_10 days have passed; 8 remain_

A tenday has passed since your triumphant return to Leuthilspar bearing the Crownblade. The Elves of Evermeet followed their queen to the mainland and prepared for war with the Cult. Vowing not to make the same mistake twice, Araevin elected to remain with Ilsevele and her army. From the balcony of the Lord's Palace in Waterdeep, you watched the conscripted armies of the Lord's Alliance prepare to march on the Well of Dragons, even as the city mourned the death of its former Open Lord, Dagult Neverember.

The trail to the final shard did not yield easily. In the end, the key lay in the origins of the crystal itself. The earliest mentions of it in Evermeet's archives were stories of a wandering Elven mage named Morthil, who came to serve an early Elven nation somewhere in the far East. The imperial archives on Evermeet held that the crystal was originally created by Morthil to seal away an unnamed Elder Evil – a dangerous and insane god that threatened the nation he served. Having forged the crystal for this purpose but fearing its use as a weapon, Morthil created a special plane of imprisonment and sealed himself away as eternal guardian along with the malevolent god, scattering the shards of the crystal. The crystal was later reassembled and used to devastating effect by the great empire of Arcorar in the Elven Crown Wars.

The other piece of the puzzle turned out to be an old map of the Elven empires, tucked into the back of a dusty dynastic history book. A note scrawled in the lower left near a sprawling forest read, in archaic Elvish, "Here of old was Yuireshanyaar, which now is hidden." Its location on the map was in the modern-day nation of Aglarond, well over 2,000 miles east of Waterdeep across the Sea of Fallen Stars, nearly on the doorstep of Thay. With this, a theory started to take shape: the nation Morthil once served was this Yuireshanyaar. Unable to defeat the Elder Evil outright, Morthil had not created a new realm, but instead used the crystal to sever a piece of the material plane, entombing himself and his entire nation with the monster as its guardians.

This did help explain why the crystal's signal felt strangely faint in pointing to the third shard – it might rest in a place outside, but overlapping, the material plane. But the question remained: how to access a secret demiplane, hidden from the world for millenia, if it even existed? The Harpers brought you whispers of ancient circles of standing stones deep in the Yuirwood, passages to the Feywild and other realms besides. At least it was a place to start.

The dark blot of forest that stretched across that old map failed to capture one important detail: it is hot in Aglarond. The Yuirwood is a dense, humid tangle – nearer to a jungle than a forest. Rioting deep green foliage presses in from every direction, amid the strange cries of brightly-colored birds and dripping of water. More than any other you have visited, this forest feels primeval. Somewhere ahead, the last shard beckons you onward.
