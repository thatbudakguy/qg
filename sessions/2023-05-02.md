# Scenes
## Opening
the iron tiger has just appeared. everything seems to be happening in slow motion.
re-roll initiative
 
### lorica notes
- strange, dull green metal with runes in Thayan scrawled across it, covering every surface with rusty red writing that must once have been shining crimson. in some places the writing has faded fully (which is what makes the invisibility not perfect in this particular one).
- functions as an Adamantine breastplate: medium armor, AC is 14 + dex modifier (max 2). no penalties to stealth and no required strength. any crits against you become normal hits while wearing it.
- putting on the lorica if you're not undead results in a CON save to avoid immediately dying. If you succeed, you still permanently reduce your max HP by 2d10 each day. when it reaches zero, you die and then wake as undead. if you take it off, you recover a number of max HP each day equal to your CON mod (or something).
- the lorica has two shoulder-mounted "projectors" that create magical effects when active. the wearer can activate one or both "projectors" at will. doing so costs one charge; the lorica has 3 charges and regains all uses at dawn. when active, each effect lasts for one minute. the effects are cast at fifth level for the purpose of _dispel magic_, which ends any active effect and prevents the effect from being reactivated until all charges are recovered.
- one of the shoulder projectors creates a _greater invisibility_ effect (but, because this lorica is slightly degraded, there is a 25% chance that attackers don't have disadvantage).
- the other shoulder projector creates a _haste_ effect (without any negative aftereffects).

### sahnd notes
- sahnd has "undead nature" (no need for air, food, water, sleep)
- damage resistances: necrotic, fire; bludgeoning, piercing, slashing from nonmagical attacks
- damage immunities: poison
- condition immunities: charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned
- very high CON, DEX, STR due to his semi-mechanical construction. proficient in all these saves as well
- can't speak, but understands common. 
- no disadvantage imposed on point blank shots with launcher arm (as crossbow expert feat). if doesn't move & no other actions taken besides shooting the crossbow (i.e. steady aim), has advantage on the shot.
- darkvision 60ft
- weapons? 
	- grappleshot heavy crossbow (enchanted). range 100/400. 1d10 + STR piercing on hit. has two "barrels"; one slung underneath for the grappleshot and one conventional up top.
	- life drinker longsword. 1d10 + DEX and 1d8 necrotic. when you score a critical, all damage is restored as HP to the wielder.
- actions
	- grappleshot (ranged weapon attack), 1d10 + STR. uses launcher to fire a hook with attached rope. the target is automatically grappled if large or smaller. can use a bonus action to make a grapple check to pull the grappled target to within 5ft of the wielder. alternatively, if the shot makes contact and penetrates a target's AC or object, the action can be used to move sahnd to within 5ft of the object instead.
	- heavy crossbow (ranged weapon attack)
	- multiattack (three longsword attacks)
- reactions
	- parry (sahnd adds 4 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, sahnd must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.)
