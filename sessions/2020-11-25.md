- "Scattered fires continue to burn across the camp, and the area is choked with a mixture of smoke and fog from the sea. You lost track of time hours ago, or anyway it feels like it's been hours, and the moon is shielded from view. In front of you, outside the mouth of the cave, you can see the lifeless body of Jeralla slumped over next to the fire. Further out in the fog, shapes might be moving dimly, but the din of battle has subsided. The owlbear is nowhere to be seen."
- To the characters in the cave, Sahnd holds up a hand, indicating they should not yet venture out. He orders one of the characters to go check that all of the captives are still present. Declan goes to investigate the wagon. After awhile, since there's no threat, Sahnd gathers all who are present to make a speech.
- "Well, it seems my purpose here is at an end. Tiamat didn't show much concern for her daughter's welfare." [to calcey] "You're a fearsome shot with that hand crossbow. I'd give you a spot on my crew if you hadn't already murdered all of them." [to all] "Before you decide to fetter me or take my head, let me tell you my story. It's the reason I couldn't stay in the city I loved."
- "Any self-respecting mooneye knows the story of Ren o' The Blade, but you'd do well to also remember that Ren was a rogue to his friends and a thief to all those who hated him. I never claimed going after caravans was honest work, but in my mind it all depends who you steal from - and apparently stealing from Phlan's richest makes *me* a thief. Anyway. Back to Ren."
- "Ren and his friends saved the city back in the 1300s more than once. They did that by relentlessly beating back the hordes of orcs and undead that controlled most of Phlan, and any historian will tell you that the reason for all that evil was the commanding influence of the Lord of the Ruins, also known as the Great Possessor - a spirit from another world that wanted to control Phlan, and then the Moonsea."
- "But Ren didn't start out as a crusader to save the city. He and his friends were *forced* into dangerous missions outside the walls as punishment by one of the city councilmen - initially all because they started a bar fight. And when the jobs got harder, and they kept succeeding? That councilman reaped the benefits. Porphyrys Cadorna started out as Fourth Councilman, and in the span of a few short months after he met Ren, he ascended to First Councilman. Pretty tidy arrangement - Ren's gang get to be heroes, everybody wins."
- "All this is in the records, you don't have to take my word for it. What I wanted to know was this:
- "That crafty bastard was playing both sides against each other. He was feeding the Lord of the Ruins information about the City - where guards were posted, when supplies were being shipped - in exchange for coin, and then turning around and sending Ren to clean up every mess, while he took the credit for everything. He had a heart blacker than a moonless night."
- "Now there are some who might say that all that business a hundred years ago should be left to lie, and I understand that - to a point. What I couldn't get over was the idea that the wealthiest house in Phlan, the one people talk about as having founded the modern version of our city, was built on a bedrock of lies. Not a scrap of the coin that made that house noble was legitimately made."
- "When I started making noise about this, I found out just how deep in the noble's pockets Brahms really is. It was barely a tenday before they drew up some trumped-up charges that I was plotting against Brahms himself, going to take down the Fists from the inside. I was a bad apple, and they couldn't let me spoil the barrel. It was bullshit of the first order. I had never so much as put a toe out of place, and they knew it. When I left, there were a few who went with me."
- "Hitting the caravans was never the endgame - it was just a way to make them hurt, a kind of direct action. I won't rest until the Moonsea knows what the Cadornas did, and the blood is on their hands."
- When the gang gets ready to leave King's Pyre - either by land (forest above) or by sea (by crossing the river/going back to the sea cave) - the owlbear attacks again. It could be hiding in a tree, or otherwise using some terrain to its advantage. It rushes out and attacks the player who is furthest from the group. As soon as it knocks a player unconscious, it picks the player up in its beak and dashes to the nearest cave or tree to attempt to get away with them.
