## Lizardfolk Council

The Lizardfolk of the Scaly Death tribe have gathered to hear the council of the human warriors that Snapjaw has told them about. They have been gathering together above the forge for weeks in secret to debate what to do. Three schools of thought are prevalent, each with an individual proponent. Snapjaw has invited them to speak, after which the "softskins" will be invited to say their piece. They are:

- Snapjaw himself, who speaks in favor of open revolt. He shows the characters the weapons that the lizardfolk have stockpiled and talks about how they suffer the arrogance of the Bullywugs every day, but the Bullywugs would be the first to leave if danger really appeared.

> I AM SNAPJAW. YOU LOOK WHAT US PEOPLE MAKE. [snapjaw indicates the cache of steel weapons] PEOPLE SAVE SHINY WEAPON FOR LONG TIME. AFTER SUNCALLER DIE FROGS ALWAYS HURT PEOPLE. EVERY DAY FROG ARE HURTING PEOPLE BUT FROG AFRAID MAGIC. FROG MOST AFRAID MAGIC FROG WARRIOR. FROG ALWAYS AFRAID. IF FROG WARRIOR DIE, ALL FROG WILL LEAVE AFRAID. PEOPLE ONLY NEED KILL DRAGON KNEELERS WHEN FROGS LEAVE. US PEOPLE READY TO FIGHT. READY TO DIE.

- Bogclaw, a female hunter who often ranges outside the castle. She reminds everyone that Suncaller was killed by Pharblex because of his command of magic, and that the cultists have no shortage of magic at their disposal. Her argument is that the time simply isn't right yet for open revolt; the tribe needs more weapons and needs to wait until it has a better position to take out Pharblex, who is too closely guarded.

> I AM BOGCLAW. FROG WARRIOR USE MAGIC. LEADER SUNCALLER STRONG BUT FROG WARRIOR KILL SUNCALLER. DRAGON KNEELERS USE MAGIC. MANY DRAGON KNEELERS IN CASTLE. US PEOPLE NOT USE MAGIC. PEOPLE NEED SHINY WEAPON. NOW NOT MANY SHINY WEAPON. IF MANY SHINY WEAPON MAYBE KILL FROG WARRIOR. PEOPLE NEED WAIT FOR MORE WEAPON. NOW NOT TIME FOR FIGHT. YOU THINK MY WORDS.
> 
- Scalecrusher, one of the two prison guards who watches over Leosin and Sirge. He expresses the tribe's disbelief that Voaraghamanthar does not help them, and interprets this as a sign that they are meant to serve the cult. He reminds everyone that the cult could ask for Voaraghamanthar's help against them, and even if they succeed, they might ultimately not win the favor of the dragon.

> I AM SCALECRUSHER. YOU LISTEN MY WORDS. WHY GREAT BLACK DRAGON NOT HELP US? DRAGON KNEELERS TAKE TREASURE DRAGON. MAYBE DRAGON NEED MORE TREASURE BEFORE HELP US. MAYBE DRAGON LOVE SOFTSKINS NOT LOVE US PEOPLE. IF PEOPLE FIGHT DRAGON KNEELERS MAYBE DRAGON COME KILL PEOPLE. IF PEOPLE KILL DRAGON KNEELERS MAYBE DRAGON NOT LOVE US PEOPLE. PEOPLE NEED WAIT FOR DRAGON. DRAGON MORE STRONG THAN MAGIC. DRAGON MORE STRONG THAN SHINY WEAPON.
