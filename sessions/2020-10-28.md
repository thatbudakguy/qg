# Session Notes 2020-10-28

Date: October 28, 2020

# Announcements

- Halloween episode is in the works! We will convene at our normal time Sunday and maybe go a little longer than usual. See Discord post for background and DM me with character or background questions.
- Create your character in D&D beyond and I'll add you to a new campaign for the halloween oneshot. Let's pick a name for the new gang.
- If the quarantine gang survive this adventure, they will level up, so keep that in mind.
- While I work on the feat system, DM me the top 3 feats you're interested in so that I can consider how to work them into the storyline.
- I'll contact you in the next few weeks with a detailed outline of your character background, because it'll start to become gradually more important from this point on.

# Notes

- Check marching order as they come up the cave, and ask how they are seeing in the dark.
- As soon as they come up out of the cave, they see the outlaw who is making her move.
- If they take out this outlaw silently, after some time has passed the other one will notice that no move has been made, and come notify the camp, who will send a runner to Krulek.
- If they go for Little Erik first, remember he gets DA for 1d3 rounds if they do the screech owl. Also, at the end of each round, roll a die and and if you get an odd number the main camp is alerted.
- If the characters enter the light, Kai gives a crow call to warn Krulek, who arrives in 5 rounds. If combat breaks out, Kai gives the call and also ziplines down to engage. If the characters fake like it's the Claws, Kai fires the flaming arrow instead, and comes down the zipline.
- If they go for the camp first, Kai fires the arrow as soon as combat breaks out and Little Erik arrives in 2 rounds.
- Ruse, the Tashalan berserker, speaks with a Nigerian accent: "mai ozzband" = my husband. Roll the R's: "soamwan 'as been sneeking ayrrround. go an fine dem." "dey ah hiyahd goonz sent by dee mehchaantz." Open your lips super wide on vowels. T becomes D.
- Little Erik the calishite speaks with a sort of Turkish accent; t becomes d. Heavy voice: "what was dat." sounds like dracula but can pronounce W. "yoo caunt run." Also a little bit like the TF2 heavy.
- When they go into Krulek's tent remember the flying sword in the chest.
