# Outline
## Bang
> As you approach the College of Magic in the cool spring night, the Archmage leads you to a massive Shadowtop tree, easily three hundred feet tall. Dim lights glitter from stained-glass windows high up in the trunk. On the ground floor, an ironbound door hewn out of the roots opens to reveal a young Elf with close-cropped hair dyed blue, who appears to be staring off into space, his eyes half-closed. He sits on a simple wooden stool behind a great oak desk, a massive ledger chained to the front next to a well-used quill and bottle of ink.
## Library
The library is inside a single massive Shadowtop tree, with one large spiral staircase that winds its way up hundreds of feet into the air. Each floor, about 30 feet on a side, is devoted to a single subject. On the ground floor is a "reception" area where the student on duty checks that no one is bringing in weapons or taking out books that aren't allowed out. No books above the 10th floor may leave the library.

Alyn Vrye is the student assigned to the reception desk at this hour, and he's in reverie. Alyn wants to know:
- if it's true about the vampire taking Mithriel
- if it's true that Dragon-worshippers are coming to burn the Vine Vale

Araevin reminds Alyn to stay vigilant and to immediately contact him if he has a strange interaction with a Cold Hand soldier, or if he encounters Mithriel, and to avoid contact with suspicious people at all costs.
### Facts
- _Feast of Blood_ (written in Common)
	- When true vampires feed on a humanoid victim, they drain vitality and enrich their own.
	- If the victim dies this way and is buried in the ground, it rises as a spawn wholly under the control of the vampire.
	- Spawn are only set free with the death of their vampire, or in the rare circumstance that a vampire allows the spawn to drink its blood.
- _Vaeril's Complete Genealogy of Evermeet: Vol. XVII_ (written in Elvish)
	- The Morgias were once one of the great noble houses of Evermeet, in the time before the Age of Humanity.
	- The patriarch made a deal with a powerful Vampire named Malkizid in order to gain the power and wealth to ascend to the throne, but was discovered
	- Malkizid's price was allowing the family to be converted into Vampires, since he sought to turn all of Evermeet into his spawn
	- The Morgias were exiled to Faerun
- _Children of the Night_ (written in Common)
	- Vampires can transform into both bats and a cloud of mist
	- Vampires can still bite you as a bat!
	- Vampires can summon bats, rats, wolves, and other creatures to aid them, and such creatures naturally are attracted by vampire lairs
	- Even when not in any animal form, vampires can climb on any surface
- _On the Efficient Destruction of Vampires_ (written in Elvish)
	- Lots of people think any light will do: no, it might be true sunlight
	- Lots of people think any water will do: no, it must either be holy or be running naturally
	- Lots of people think staking will do: no, you must do it when the vampire is in its place of rest, and even then it is only paralyzed by this
## Scrying on Talis
If Araevin is asked to scry on Talis, see [scrying](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scrying). If the spell succeeds, Araevin sees Talis at a war council with the other Wyrmspeakers at the Well of Dragons. The room would be deep in a cave in the cult base. After only a minute or two, Araevin breaks off the scry as he gets a sense that he was about to be discovered. He would see/hear the following: 
- A man wearing a turban with a goatee is speaking in an imperious voice to a tall silver-haired human, a bald dwarf with a long brown beard and staff, and a half-elven woman in white plate armor. All but the last were wearing ornate purple robes.
- The man wearing the turban orders the dwarf to "sound the great horn". He also orders the others to contact their "companions", including asking the half-elven woman if she still speaks with "the Cloudchaser." He says they could move any moment to reclaim the hoard and the mask; they must be ready to move as soon as Elves are defenseless.
- The woman in white asks if leading this assault will be sufficient for her to ascend to Wyrmspeaker. The turban-wearing man cuts her off harshly â€” "you KNOW what is required. Trouble me no longer with this until it is again in our grasp."
