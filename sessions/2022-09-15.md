# Recap
![[a3e22]]
# Outline
> You're standing in the office of the Lord Sage of Phlan â€” in another life, Ranthor, court mage of Cormyr. The floor is covered with parchment, scrolls, and books, strewn about by whoever broke in. In the secret vault behind one of the bookcases, which stands open, is a note from Talis the White, reading as follows:
![note-from-talis](../handouts/note-from-talis.md)
## Mantor's library
- INT investigation checks to examine the office reveal:
	- whoever burgled the office was in a hurry. they probably got to the shield in a few minutes (DC 10)
	- whoever burgled the office didn't come from the scroll chamber. the dust on the carpet reveals they left a different way (DC 15)
- CHA investigation checks to ask bystanders or Black Fists in the library reveal:
	- two people in scribe's clothes got into an altercation outside the scroll chamber (DC 10)
	- nobody recognized the two people who were fighting, and as soon as someone said Fists were coming, their quarrel evaporated (DC 15)
	- there was a riot at the Stojanow Gate prison a tenday ago involving some former Black Fists who were put away after the battle at Valhingen (DC 20)
## Draakhorn
on the morning of the 16th, everyone is awakened by the sound of the draakhorn.
> You wonder what roused you from sleep. Araevin's eyes are already open and alert, his face showing alarm. "Do you hear that?" At first, it's really the silence that stands out. No seabirds calling, no murmur of merchants from the street outside, no sound of waves of the Moonsea lapping at the docks. Then you realize there's some kind of strange sound underlying...everything. A deep bass, so low and rumbling that it's almost inaudible. But it feels...wrong, somehow. As you strain to hear it, a dog somewhere starts barking nervously, and then another, and then another, until animals all over Phlan are shouting in alarm in a chorus of voices.

Shortly after, Araevin's student Alyn contacts him via *sending* to inform him that Watcher Over the Hills Erlan Duirsar has requested his presence back in Evereska to report on the noise that was heard to the Hill Elders.
## Talis encounter
### Enemies
- Talis herself
- Glazhael, adult white dragon
- Kusphia, dragonfang
- Maelgot and Sorvic, veterans
- Any number of dragonclaws or dragonwings, optionally
### Location
Talis wants to have the deal take place at her hunting lodge, but may consent to doing it elsewhere. If it does take place at the hunting lodge, Trepsin and several trolls are there, along with guard drakes, and the staff of the lodge (including kobolds).
