# Scenes
## Outside the Tower
> 
## Entering the Tower
 start with a skill challenge. then we cut to in media res.

- core check is deception. you are posing as someone you are not in order to gain access to the tower. characters who fail will be denied access.
- two bumps on difficulty (DC 16).
- two bumps on expense. you have to spend hella money on costumes, or to show off to someone that you're rich, etc.
- two on delay. because you're unfamiliar, your "references" have to be checked before you're allowed in. Salvar also hasn't been back to the tower in awhile, so he has some things to answer for.
- one on displacement. some of you get pulled away for further questioning.
- two on indiscretion. somebody can tell that you're not who you say you are.
