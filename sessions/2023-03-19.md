# Scenes
## Southroad Keep
- Southroad Keep, Mulmaster's oldest building, is the heart of its bureaucracy, serving as the headquarters for the City Watch and tax collectors, as well as the site for Mulmaster's courts and prison.
- The squat, circular brick building serves as the constabulary headquarters, information center, tax-collection center, visitor's registration, courthouse, and prison.
- The building is nearly always crowded, and lines are long and slow. The inner chambers are constantly choked with throngs of people waiting to conduct business with the city, and the overworked officials are never in a great hurry to keep the lines moving.
- The prison lies underground and has approximately the same area as the aboveground portion. The gatehouse can seal off the city's south gate in the event of a siege. One hundred soldiers are posted here at all times, though the keep can house as many as six hundred when necessary.
- super old fieldstone from the Earthspur mountains, noticeably older and simpler than other towers. just a giant circular building
- HQ for city watch and tax collectors, courts, prison.
- Crowded, with long and slow lines.
- dungeons: prison
- first floor: courts, registration of visitors (e.g. magic users)
- second floor: city watch and governmental offices
- top floors: tax collector offices
- 100 soldiers
### Clues
- governmental offices on the second floor have documents that detail sending prisoners to the tower of arcane might "special prisoner diversion program"
- records here of the apprehension of the Hangmen, including Huru Cuttlescar, and the fact that someone intervened in their case and took special charge of it (Huru was send to the tower, but the rest were released mysteriously)
- also records here that are copies of harbormaster's records indicating both the arrival of the lenses and the shipment of thayan magical items, earmarked as special magical cargo for thurndan
- the lenses taken in the heist are stored on the top floor in the tax collector offices in a safe; they are earmarked for groshin to later come and take, but he hasn't come back to do it yet
## Flagship _Lady Dmitra_
- she's got a special slip in the north docks because it's the only one that can fit her. nearly 250ft long from bowsprit to stern.
- guarded by three units of 5 soldiers x 1 cloak at all times (bow, stern, onboard). she is not crewed while in port. High Blade Drakehorn is the captain, so she only leaves port when the High Blade is aboard.
- getting on board is a skill challenge.
### Skill Challenge
- Objective: get on board. 
- Check type: stealth
- 3/5 fill up the difficulty meter (DC 19).
- Two on displacement. You get separated while trying to avoid the patrols.
- Three on indiscretion. The ship is tightly guarded by patrols of soldiers and cloaks, and is magically warded to detect intruders. You trigger a guard device.
- Two on injury. The patrols are ordered to attack first and ask questions later. You get burned and stabbed.
- One on affliction. A magical ward or other effect casts a debilitating spell on one of you.
### Interior
- hold (1): food stores, armory, brig, bilge
- lower deck (2): cabins, galley, head, navigation room
- main deck (3): bridge (raised), armored forecastle (raised, has reality weapon)

The forecastle is protected by thick lead armor plates, and the area around the weapon has manacles that are chained to the deck with grates to flush blood out through the sides of the ship.

## Sewers
### Adventuring
- Characters can use the sewers to attempt to travel to underneath any location within the boundaries of the City Walls.
- Characters travel at a pace of 2 miles per hour, which is the "slow" pace listed in the DMG. Attempting to travel faster is possible, but you will be automatically surprised.
- The city is 10 miles from northernmost point to southernmost point.
- Every hour spent in the sewers calls for an encounter check. Roll any die; odds are an encounter and evens are nothing.
- Any time a character enters the sewer water, they must make a DC 14 CON saving throw or be poisoned for 1 day. A character that succeeds in this save doesn't need to make it again for that day.

## Traveller's Cloak
- Salvar is dressed in the garb of the Cloaks, but appears nervous, picking at his food and flicking his eyes between a journal that sits open in front of him and other people in the room. He sizes up the party, looks to the door, looks at other cloaks, etc.
- Groshin, by contrast, is utterly relaxed, yet has chosen what is very obviously the most secure seat in the building, in a rear corner with excellent view of nearly the entire building. He has strange paint below his eyes. Occasionally people come over to his table to speak with him in a low voice and he will smile, nod, etc. Other hawks sit with him.

### Salvar
- sassy, somewhat flamboyant voice? prone to staring off in space, heavy sighs, etc. gets a little teary when talking about cyprian.
- reminds the party that they need to register if they're staying.
- is both noble (mother Desona Brix is a blade) and a cloak. his family name got him far, but not far enough to conceal his obvious lack of talent.
- knows that Thurndan was out conducting sea trials of the _Lady Dmitra_. pissed that he was not invited to be on the ship's maiden voyage. heard about blood on decks?
- former boyfriend Cyprian Balefrost was the one working closely with Gensor in the lab who figured out that the thing used in the scale model of the weapon was the GKC
- has been staking out the Traveller's Cloak to try to overhear or catch a sign that one of the Cloaks here was the one who betrayed Cyprian.
- will talk to the PCs, but not unless it's in the safety of a room or someplace outside the inn.
- has Cyprian's notes because he left them with Salvar ("I just feel like he was trying to tell me something!"), but can't get access to Cyprian's personal effects, which are stored in a safe that only opens using his personal seal in the Tower of Arcane Might.
- Thinks Declan looks a bit like Cyprian...Cyprian was a _sorcerer_. He had _dragon blood_. (he starts crying)
