# Scenes
## Opening
The PCs have just crowded into a small alcove with a **defiled shrine to Moradin**, which Peregrine would recognize (also, he can sense this place has been desecrated).

Moradin is dressed simply, in a blacksmith's leather tunic, but he wears beautiful bracers on his forearms. One hand, presumably holding his forge hammer, has been broken off, and his nose has been smashed. He wears a great Dwarven helmet, and his face retains the look of intense concentration the sculptor gave him, focused on the anvil in front of him that has been splashed with dried blood and its contents removed. His great beard reaches almost to the floor.

> [!INFO] Praying to Moradin or otherwise restoring the shrine will grant inspiration to a PC who does so.
