# Scenes
## Opening
- "saerista silmerhelve" continues to give more information about the Draakhorn, Maccath, and the Sea of Moving Ice.

>“The Sea of Moving Ice was the last known location of the _Draakhorn_. No one can pinpoint its present location from the sound, or even verify with certainty that the relic is still in the northern sea, but the search must start there. The one person who could tell us more is a tiefling sorcerer called Maccath the Crimson. No one alive knows more about the _Draakhorn_ than her, but the Arcane Brotherhood, of which she is a member, hasn’t seen her for three years. She was investigating the Sea of Moving Ice when she disappeared.”

About Maccath:

> “Maccath reported her progress to the Hosttower by way of sending spells. Her last report spoke of seeing Ice Hunters paddling their sealskin boats toward a huge iceberg, flattened like a plateau across its surface, but ringed by icy peaks. She had intended to follow the Ice Hunters and investigate the iceberg, which she believed to be the lair of a white dragon named Arauthator, called Old White Death. After that, no more reports came. Attempts to find Maccath using scrying and other magical means located only her ship, adrift and heavily damaged. Some of the ship’s crew were seen dead, but no sign of the tiefling sorcerer was ever found. However, the lair of a dragon as powerful as Arauthator is no doubt protected against scrying magic. If Maccath is alive, in addition to the lore she can share regarding the _Draakhorn_, the Arcane Brotherhood would be most grateful to get her back.”

- on hearing the above, Peregrine can make a check to remember finding a note in the wreckage of Skyreach that was written to Rezmir from another cultists describing getting something with the help of Old White Death, something as powerful as skyreach.
- someone on the council demands a source; lady saerista refuses to provide it.
- harpers reveal the location of the cult's base at the well of dragons
- the "attack now" coalition (ravengard? frume?) forward a motion to send a military expedition
- harpers forward the idea that they should seek out Wyrmspeakers
## Departure
- "Klaus Half-face" is the captain of *Frostskimmr*, the ship that will take the gang north to the Sea of Moving Ice
- crew 40, 60ft long longship with one sail
