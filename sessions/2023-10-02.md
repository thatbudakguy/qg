# Recap
- declan convinces the guard that the Doom Raiders sent them personally, so he lets them into their room
- Peregrine notices inside the room that its occupant has marked up a manuscript about nature gods, focusing on Eldath
- Declan finds a note written by someone who didn't find information on a lich named Vrandak the Burnished, and is evidently dragging their feet on procuring cold-weather gear
- Declan narrowly manages to dispel a powerful spell trap affecting a locked chest in the room, which turns out to contain several potions and a _programmed illusion_ cube like the one recovered from gensor's lab
- on this cube, gensor appears, giving strange instructions for how to operate and send the other cube back to him. he also reveals what he promised to the DRs as payment: the topaz recovered from his lab. Evidently, the soul bound within the gem is that of a Chosen of one of the Gods themselves. as proof, Gensor names a list of people and their associated gods, along with a place and time. Last on the list is Curran Sunhearth, Chosen of Tymora, Mulmaster, about two years before the present day.
- sent Araevin to ask about some sort of lost city of Eldath in the tortured land
- talked to Ontharr; he said things were bad and asked P to talk to Bahamut/metallic dragons
- remembered that dragon fam is in city
- courier came up with note for P
# Scenes

## Opening
as you're standing on the steps, holding a scrap of parchment with an address in your hands, Calcey walks up.

- clockwork leg: +5ft to your speed. you are vulnerable to lightning damage and it also stops working for 1d4 rounds if you take lightning damage
- spirit leg: once per day, you can ask the leg's previous owner a question and it will answer truthfully. you are vulnerable to necrotic damage.
- wooden leg: you can hide small objects in it and nobody will check because it's rude. you are vulnerable to fire damage.

## Jaeger's House
> [!QUESTION] What tells you that Jaeger hadn't been living in this place for very long?
### Levels
1. the interior of the apartment: master bedroom, kitchen, drawing room, guest bedroom, cellar
2. adjoining apartments, where wealthier citizens are painting, talking, eating, reading, etc.
3. the street outside, with foot and horse/cart traffic, city watch, etc.
### Clues
- an actual fox's canine tooth 2in long, used to be worn or carried by Peregrine's former 2nd-in-command of Foxteeth. describe them:
	- what was their strength in the gang?
	- why were they still not ready to take the lead when you left?
	- pronouns & name
- a cache of letters written from Helga (Peregrine's mother) to Jaeger
	- a watercolor portrait of Helga. what detail about her do you notice that you never knew previously?
	- one mentions people not taking kindly to her research on ancient Elven clans at Candlekeep (Eldreth Valuuthra)
	- she gets nervous about being continually watched, even after leaving Candlekeep. increasingly erratic letters
	- one asks if she can come stay with him, written from nearby village, since she has no other options
- signs of a struggle in the house: how do you know that jaeger was killed here, and it was poorly covered up?
### Traps
- on the kitchen table, a letter written addressed to peregrine. it has a _glyph of warding_; when read the glyph triggers a sixth-level _fireball_ (11d6 fire damage, DC 16 dex save for half). the building immediately begins burning and collapsing; it collapses after three rounds
- cult assassins on a stakeout in a nearby apartment, waiting for the glyph to be triggered. they're led by Varick, a tall, redheaded illuskan guy with a long scar that goes up and splits his hair, Peregrine's former handler
### Treasures
- jaeger's emergency stash: 250 gold pieces, half a brick of haunspeir. his lucky loaded dice.
