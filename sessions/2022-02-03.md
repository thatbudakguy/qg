# Bang
> As the crowds begin to disperse, Araevin strides toward you, his strange silver eyes glinting in the fading light of early evening. "Come, let us examine this mask in my offices at the College. I have many more questions for you."
## Talking with Araevin
- araevin "i only agreed to be archmage on one condition: getting an office with a view where i could watch the sun set on the shaeradim."

- getting permission to go investigate the wreck of skyreach
	- araevin calls manynests to go ask erlan if this is alright
- examining the black dragon mask
	- 
- getting their weapons back
	- Araevin: it would be a sign of goodwill to let them remain at the Starmeadow Tower for now. but if you earn Kinyon's trust, maybe you can have them back.
- finding a place to sleep (in a bed!)
	- See below Q about asking if they are harpers, "there are, unfortunately, very old traditions about this..."
	- The Unicorn and Crescent is where they can go
- sending the moonstars or phlan folks
	- Araevin: do you happen to know any musicians who play sad songs on happy occasions?
	- Leosin or the Moonstars: tracking down a relic-hunting mission the cult 
	- Phlan folks: worried but happy they are alive. Hearing reports that villages across the sword coast were assaulted by dragons during the winter.
