## The Key of Memory
- **Motivation**: Provide a refuge in memory from the sorrows of the world
- **Sensory details**: The smell of wood smoke, far-off laughter of children, gentle wind in leaves
- **At the table**: "Starwood Choker"
When you use the key to open a door with a lock, the door opens into an extradimensional room. It is warm and immaculately clean inside, and the room is full of luxury the likes of which you have never experienced. If you try to open the window or break the walls, they will not yield. You can only enter and leave through the door.

the room is eryn's former home in the Elven Court of Cormanthor, as it appeared during her childhood almost 200 years ago. it is high up in a shadowtop tree. through the windows can be seen scenes of domestic life in the Elven Court: children playing, lovers reclining on the forest floor, people coming and going (ask Declan to describe what he sees). the room has a four-poster bed made from shadowtop wood with curtains.

When you open the door to leave and think about a door you have seen before, roll+nothing.
✴ On a 10+, the door will open to whichever door you thought of. If you think of no door in particular, it opens to the door you originally entered from. 
✴ On a 7-9, same as above, but the GM chooses 1.
- You arrive but more or less time has passed than expected (hours, days, months, years).
- You draw unwanted attention from the normal world or the space between dimensions.
- You are confused, sick, weak, or shaky from the transition back to the normal world.
    
When you leave the room carrying the key and the door shuts behind you, anything you have left behind disappears and the room resets (the room is clean and the bed is made) as if you had never been there.

## Selfaril Coldshore
Former High Blade of Mulmaster, imprisoned in the _Sword of Selfaril_

**Motivation**: Reclaim his rightful title as High Blade
**Sensory details**: The sense that a stronger hand than yours grips the blade, the smell of old leather and sweat, a wild sensation of freedom
**At the table**: Profanity-laced, bitter rants interspersed with a desire for a drink

The _Sword of Selfaril_ is an ornate longsword that functions as a +2 Longsword while Selfaril's soulgem is installed in pommel. Selfaril is joined telepathically to the wielder, and speaks directly to them when they are wielding the sword (no attunement needed).

Selfaril can be freed via a 9th-level _dispel magic_ or if the condition of his imprisonment is lifted: Mulmaster must be doomed.
## Coronal Ilsevele Miritar
- **Motivation**: Keep her people safe
- **Sensory details**: Pale w/ copper hair in braids, twin shortwords and deep red yew bow, serious manner
- **At the table**: Usage of 'so' ("and so you have", "so it is", etc.), short temper

Ilsevele has traveled to the mainland to report that Red Wizard agents and summoned demons broke into Tower Reilloch on Evermeet, apparently seeking a shard of the _Gatekeeper's Crystal_ in the vaults of the tower. But that shard was no longer there. Nevertheless, two of the high mages of Araevin's (near) former circle (Cyandril and Lashon) were killed. She clearly blames Araevin for having deserted the island.
