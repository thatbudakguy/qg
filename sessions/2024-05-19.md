## Journey to Nimlith

You slept in lavish apartments in the center of Leuthilspar last night. What do we see you doing in the morning?

- Zaltarish comes in and announces that they will be leaving for Nimlith shortly. He will be serving as their translator.
- Governor Veldann has ordered that you be shown the better parts of the countryside en route to the city. Your food and lodging will be taken care of.
- Lady Durothil's entourage will be joining us. You'll have half the nobility of Evermeet with you; a rare privilege.
- You are to be cultural ambassadors on your return to the continent. You will be expected to speak of your experiences in Evermeet.
- The journey will take two days. For the first day, you will follow the river Shaelyn to its source at the Lake of Dreams, also the site of the former Summer Palace. On the second day you will arrive at the city of Nimlith.
- Questions?

### The First Day

- The river Shaelyn is a broad, slow-moving river that winds through the heart of the island. It is lined with willows and silverleaf trees, and the water is clear and cold.
- The road is well-maintained and lined with statues of elven heroes. The sun is shining, and the birds are singing.

Pausing at midday
- a pastoral town with a market square
- a group of children playing in the river
- the knights and spellarchers take off their armor and bathe

An animated disagreement between some of the Veldann and Durothil soldiers, in Elvish. Do you intervene?

(they're arguing about who is going to be the first to retrieve the Crownblade, and who is worthy of wielding it. both groups believe that the Gang has been sent to retrieve it discreetly, but both are forbidden from harming the Gang and intend to tail them to the blade's location.)

Rumors:
- The lake of dreams has mermaids living in it.
- The summer palace 

Calcey's feeling kinda peckish...and it's a full moon tonight?


### The Summer Palace

## Journey to Corellon's Grove

First, let's define the dramatis personae. We have Declan, Araevin, and Ilsevele.

- What do they want? We can define these for Declan and then read out everyone's.
- What are they hiding? We can define these for Declan, but keep them secret.

We're going to have a series of scenes that take place during the journey. Hannah can pick a scene from the scenes menu, starting with "Departure". After the scene is over, we'll cut to the rest of the party. While they are playing, think about what scene you want to do next.

### Dramatis Personae

#### Declan Truefire

Wants:

Hiding:

#### Araevin Teshurr

Wants:

- to be reminded that he is an Elf
- to know that Ilsevele still loves him
- to see Declan attain his full power as a Chosen of Mystra

Hiding:

- Araevin once had a familiar, Whyllwyst, a gray falcon. Whyllwyst was killed by a group of drow assassins in the Underdark. Araevin has never forgiven himself for not being able to save her.
- Araevin founded the Company of the White Star, an adventuring group that included his fiancee Ilsevele, the human priest of Lathander Grayth Holmfast, and the air genasi rogue Maresa Rost. When the Daemonfey attacked Evermeet and stole a shard of the Gatekeeper's Crystal, the Company was sent to recover it. They failed, and the shard was used to open a portal to the Abyss and take over Myth Drannor. Grayth died in the search for the Crystal. Araevin disbanded the Company and lost touch with Maresa.
- Araevin never understood why Corellon would bless Seiveril's returning of Starbrow from Arvandor, but when he saw Starbrow and Ilsevele together, it wounded him deeply to see how clearly happy Ilsevele was. He undertook the Tel'Miirkara'Neshyr partly out of shame, thinking Seiveril had effectively replaced him with Starbrow in Ilsevele's heart.
- The final shard of the crystal may have returned to one of the places Araevin was never able to go: deep in the Yuirwood of Aglarond. Ancient legends describe a mythal like the one that created evermeet, but cast by a mythical race of "Star Elves" who disappear from the historical record tens of thousands of years ago. They refused to participate in the mythal that raised Evermeet, electing to withdraw from the world instead.

#### Ilsvele Miritar

Wants:

- an apology from Araevin for choosing magic over her
- forgiveness from Declan for having abandoned him
- to know that Araevin still loves her

Hiding:

- When Araevin and Ilsevele were young and traveling together on the Continent, she received a prophecy from an old Gur woman that she would "court three loves and lose them all, be twice crowned and twice dethroned, and bear but one child to be raised by another's hand."
- On the hundredth anniversary of her marriage, Starbrow begged to be returned to his family and his rest in Arvandor. Ilsevele granted his wish.
- Declan's father was named Arclath Obarskyr, the son of King Azoun V of Cormyr and rightful heir to the throne, who answered Ilsevele's call for aid. He was an excellent dancer, a shameless flirt, and completely hopeless as a soldier. He died in the battle for Myth Drannor. She knew him for 11 days.
