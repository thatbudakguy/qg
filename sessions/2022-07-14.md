# Outline
## Bang
> As you return from the darkness of the basement to regroup in the kitchen of Denlor's Tower, you recall the words of Aya Glenmiir, alluding to the strange behavior of the Lord Sage. Araevin says "Are there any particular spells you'd like me to cast while we're here? If not, I'd be only too happy to explore this tower and discover what other delightful secrets it holds...perhaps I'll learn the secrets of Genie-binding while we're here."
## Phlan
### Aya Glenmiir
- she can describe the lord sage's erratic behavior:
	- muttering about sanity and spells, protecting the brain, being safe, etc.
	- once caught him muttering, "Can he see? Does he know?"
	- saw him buying hardtack and other camp food at the market after leaving her place for tea
	- tried to casually ask her if she had any protections against scrying handy. she told him about *nondetection*, but wasn't able to cast it herself. yet he still seemed satisfied...almost as though he already knew this but had forgotten?
- Aya's last student, the noble Devon Nanther of Melvaunt, withdrew from her studies last week, apparently at the behest of his family. Aya thinks the Nanthers are preparing for war.
- Aya vaguely knows about the Moonsea League.
### The Lord Sage
- if scryed on, he appears to be in a semi-ruined castle, huddling inside a partially collapsed room against a makeshift fire. (he's at Castle Atuke). a clue to his location is a faded painted shield bearing the Atuke crest.
- at Mantor's Library, scribe master cassra brandywine can describe his increasingly erratic behavior.
- on the 11th he asked her to fetch research on Gensor/Thurndan, which Cassra noted as interesting because Calcey once asked her the same thing
- he also asked about very early history of Phlan, before the modern Daoran era, in the 800s DR. particularly
- he isn't actually in his office if anyone checks, having slipped out last night.
