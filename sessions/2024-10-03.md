# warmup

what is your character's starbucks order?

# bridge battle

turn 1 nilshai:
  - blur, blight
  - blur, black tentacles (spell save DC 16)
  - blur, ray of enfeeblement (on hagar)

remember:
- adv on saving throws magic/effects
- immune to detection and charm, as _mind blank_

- nesterin sings and hagar gets it
- marauders go for the horse (Mercury) first

## Nesterin

- british accent
- introduces himself as "Nesterin of house Deirr"
- pale skin, purple irises, flowing white hair
- gray cloak over silvery mithril mail and a quilted white doublet
- sings to cast spells and **HAGAR RECOGNIZES THE SINGING**; hums to himself
- asks a _lot_ of questions about the party
- is an aspiring metalsmith

### about the nilshai

- some say they come from the ethereal plane, the spectral reality that suffuses all existence, but sildeyuir was disjoined from the ethereal plane when our mages created this domain ages ago. i cannot fathom why they would go to such lengths to bore gates here, when your domain is so much more accessible to them...

### about peregrine

- "why do you travel with a half-dragon? my people spent centuries fighting to exterminate them in the long years when the dragons ruled with an iron first, before we retreated to sildeyuir. they are children of the Dragon Queen, made to fight in her unholy wars!"

### what he was doing

- i was to visit my cousin Leissera, at the seat of house Aerilp√©, in the south, the region where the nilshai first appeared. they have always been strong there. i followed a road i thought was safe, but the nilshai had been busy since my last trip...the forests were choked with creeping blight and strange beasts. worse still, when i arrived I found the outlands of house Aerilpe empty of even a single soul. I left that place as quickly as I could, but the nilshai caught up with me on my way home...so there is my tale. A great house of our people has vanished, and my world continues to come apart at the seams.

### about the menhir stone

- not good to stay here, fey sometimes gather around them. a few are capable of passing through. how did _you_ pass through, by the way?

# Citadel Deirr

It takes about 3 hours' more travel to reach Citadel Deirr from the Bridge.

On the way, the gang will pass a blighted area.

## blight

- black, viscous fluid oozing over the ground with an oily sheen to it
- trees and plants wither where it passes, turning greyish
- when declan looks at the blight, he can see that it's not arcane in nature; it doesn't even seem to perturb the weave at all...yet it's still magical?
- the smell of the blight fills you with frustration and anger, and when in its presence Hagar can slip into rage freely: he has to try _not_ to
- nesterin or other star elves can explain that the blight caused his people to turn on one another until they learned to stay far away from it

## The citadel

- elegant tower of pale white stone, on a hill overlooking a river
- ringed by a tall, sturdy wall made of darker granite. lights flicker in the windows.
- more castle-like than home-like, but not unfriendly
- can house a hundred or more, but clearly far less than that live here.

the guards treat Nesterin with obvious deference, he explains how he met the party

## Lord Tessaernil

- elder brother of Nesterin's mother
- long white hair bound with a platinum circlet (made by Nesterin)
- flowing robes

### info

- nesterin's sister Edennil was called to join the Chorus, the greatest honor of his people. But she died during the Wakening.
- in 1491 DR, the Chorus dealt with the Wakening, an event where the angry god seemed to suddenly stir. since then, it has been more restless in its sleep. (this was when Uzgat did the ritual with the GKC and its power went into Hagar).
