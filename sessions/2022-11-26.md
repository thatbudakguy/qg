# Scenes
## The Duel
> The wind whips off snowdrifts the height of a man and surrounds you in a swirling shroud of white. Twenty-odd Ice Hunter warriors and half as many wolf-like dogs stand loosely assembled around you, their stony faces watching you and your weapons. Torchlight illuminates the dim outlines of structures â€” snow-block shelters and yurts made from sealskins. The village's shaman seems to have disappeared, but she soon emerges from out of the inky blackness and driving snow in the company of a tall, thick-jawed man whose bare upper body and left arm are covered in a single, great tattoo of an orca whale. The contest of strength is about to begin.

Chieftain Barking Seal lays out the terms of the contest; Beauregard translates.
- no magic is allowed
- if someone else aids you, you forfeit immediately
- when someone passes out, the fight is over

Orcaheart's strategy:
- parry every round
- open with a shield bash to knock hagar prone, then switch to melee attacks

### Hagar
- you get the sense that Orcaheart is fighting out of desperation; this isn't a real contest of strength
### Peregrine
- you notice the racks of food in the torchlight and you can see that there's too much here to feed just the village
### Declan
- you become aware that you're already inside some kind of magical field. you test a spell and realize that _sending_, scrying, and some kinds of teleportation may not function reliably here.
> [!QUESTION] How do you experience this?
## Staying in the Village
- they take the gang to the village storage hut
- barking seal takes them a platter of slightly spoiled fish and explains that's how they like it
- he explains that bonecarver will answer hagar's questions, but he has questions for them in the meantime.
- who are you? where did you come from? how did you find oyaviggaton?
- beauregard translates for this part.
## Audience with Bonecarver
**Bonecarver speaks to Hagar in druidic**. She uses hand signs to show her meaning, and the (deep) voice of the wind speaks her words.

> [!QUESTION] Bonecarver does something that no one you've met since you left your tribe does, that makes you immediately think of home. What is it?

- She cast her seal bones and received a strong omen about Hagar.
- "Did the first bear send you?"
- tells the story of magnar the bear, a thousand thousand years ago, who lived in the great forest of the south, but entered the long sleep because the other animals made a deal with the people and conspired against him. Clever Oomio the first crow tricked him.
- she has been seeing visions of magnar asleep at the foot of a great tree, and she knows that he is coming awake. something has started to wake him from his slumber.
- ice hunter village has been under the control of "Old White Death" for years. If they help the party, every man, woman, and child will die.
- when you arrived, we sent runners to the caves to inform his servants you are here. if we had not, he would have killed all of us when he learned. he eats children.
- she asked the spirits to send help, someone powerful enough to help them break out from under the power of Arauthator. Is Hagar that person?
- offers to answer his questions **NO HELP HERE**
- she can cast for him:
	- _augury_ (seal bone divination)
	- _divination_ (contact the spirit of Magnar; one question)
	- _commune_ (contact the spirit Magnar; three yes/no questions)
