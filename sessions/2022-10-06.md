# Scenes
## Hunting Lodge / Declan's Trap
> The sound of huge, leathery wings echoes throughout the mountain vale as Glazhael makes his escape. In the barren grasslands in front of the hunting lodge, Peregrine stoops to pick up the *black dragon mask*, his breath visible in the cold air. A few feet away, Calcey is kneeling down next to a huge shield fashioned from a dragon's scale, her eyes and her crossbow still tracking the dragon's silhouette as it vanishes into blue sky. Behind them, a stone's throw from the stairs of the hunting lodge, a tyrannosaur thunders towards two human forms fleeing in terror. Right behind the monster is Hagar, massive axe drawn and covered in blood, bellowing his anger until it rings from the walls of the lodge. 

Declan flashback here. After it, if they live, just ask Hagar and Declan how they finish off the cultists.
## Dock Ward / Peregrine's Dream
> Peregrine is fast asleep on the floor of Vang's Armory in Phlan, the heat of the forge warming the night air. The gang are sleeping fitfully, having been awakened in the middle of the night by a strange and unsettling noise. Peregrine, age 16, is lurking in the shade of an alley in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep. A girl, perhaps 14, her face obscured by a mass of messy brown hair, is showing him something hidden in her hands: a purse, slit from the belt of a merchant, her first. The two suddenly find that they are not alone. At the other end of the alley, soundlessly, a gang of street rats has appeared. Eight of them in all, a patchwork quilt of orphans and urchins, with one leader — a tall boy with silver hair and a serene expression. He looks at Peregrine intently, without blinking. "Is there somewhere we could talk in private?"

What do you do?

Bahamut's message:
> I don't have much time. Those who wish to restore my sister to power have found themselves a new tool...something best left buried. You could say it's a relic from when she and I were more...like a family. My connection to the material plane is not as strong as it once was, but even I could feel its call. I need you to come home. Find the patron of House Silmerhelve. She'll know what to do.



## The Gathering Storm
some sort of series of vignettes, not focused on the QG but allowing for brief narrative intervention, that makes manifest the destruction and gathering power of both the cult (via the draakhorn) and the Moonsea League (via the new weapon/power/etc.)

find a system where each player has a scene and makes a handful of meaningful choices, but there's no need to roleplay, and their character is ultimately doomed in some fashion anyway a la trophy dark. let other characters say how things could go wrong and offer devil's bargains.

for each risk roll, you roll one die. if you're willing to risk mind and body, roll another. any other player can offer you a devil's bargain for a third.

1-3 = failure.
4-5 = partial success.
6 = success.


### Scornubel
> A city on a wide river, rambling and lively, with tents and temporary shelters for merchants and caravans many times the size of the small number of permanent buildings. People of all races mingling together, the river crowded with barges, narrowboats, and skiffs hauling goods back and forth. Night falls and the sounds of revelry drift up from the many disorganized camps, traders taking a well-needed rest on their way east from the cities of the Sword Coast. This is the city of Scornubel, in the Western Heartlands.

> [!QUESTION] What can we see, hear, or smell to tell us that spring is in the air in this scene?

> [!QUESTION] Please describe yourself as a member of a caravan, and what are you busy with right now?

> Suddenly, screams split the night air. Strangers sprint past through your camp, wild-eyed, running from something. A huge winged shape passes over the moon. Somewhere to the east, a fire is burning wildly. You become aware of a dim and terrifying sound, lower than the lowest bass drum, shaking the earth to its very foundations, a rumbling that seems to have no end or beginning. As you wheel about in the half-light looking for someone you know, a group of masked people in strange black costumes suddenly emerges into the firelight, carrying between them several chests overflowing with gold and jewels. You barely have a moment to duck behind a tent to avoid being seen. In the now-empty camp you've wandered into, personal items are strewn randomly about, abandoned by those who fled the attack. As you bend down to pick up a weapon, the sound of massive wingbeats overwhelms you, and you whirl around to see a dragonrider descend out of the night, clad in a great red mask. The dragon crushes crates and barrels as it fixes you with its huge, red-scaled head.

> [!WARNING] How do you react to this situation? (risk roll)
### The Doom of Thentia
> A city at the edge of great, storm-tossed sea. A great tower, set just outside the crumbling city walls, rises from the rocky coast to overlook the settlement. The harbor is crowded with tremendous black ships flying the flag of Mulmaster, their decks teeming with mercenaries and battle-mages. At the end of the pier, a small company of riders, not more than fifty strong, stand on horseback watching a tense negotiation. A man in noble colours stands, his hands raised in anger, in front of a tall silhouette in a hooded cloak. This is the city of Thentia, on the northern shore of the Moonsea.

> [!QUESTION] What can we see or hear that shows that this negotiation is balanced on a knife edge?

> [!QUESTION] Please describe yourself as a rider of Thentia, and why you decided to join the riders?

> The Watchlord's argument seems to have come to an impasse. The tall man in the hooded cloak with the sword on his back shakes his head, lifting his right arm as he does so. Suddenly there is a flurry of activity aboard the huge galleon resting at anchor a few hundred yards out into the harbor. A strange, choked scream reaches your ears on the breeze. Then everyone on the dock starts to feel something...sickening. Your stomach churns as you are overcome by the terrible sensation that the reality you are experiencing is no more real than a child's drawing on a sheet of paper, a crude drawing that is being _bent_ by some overwhelming force until it is near to snapping in half. The pressure releases in a sudden bright flash, briefly illuminating a volume of air a half-mile wide around the Watchtower in searing light — and then it's gone. A second later, everyone on the dock is staggered by a deafening thunderclap as air rushes to fill the huge vacuum where the tower once stood. Stone foundations are sheared off, their tops flat and smooth as glass, rising up to meet the edge of the sphere that was edited out of reality like a scoop of ice cream. With fear in their eyes, the soldiers from Mulmaster charge forward towards you.

> [!WARNING] How do you react to this situation? (risk roll)?
### The Path
In the North, a storm gathers in Mulmaster.
