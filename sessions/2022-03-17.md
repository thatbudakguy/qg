# Outline
## Bang
triumphant music?
> The vault is split into two levels, with an upper level that overlooks a sunken level 30 ft. below. Glittering under the surface of the icy floor of the cavern is the accumulated wealth of months of plundering across Faerun. The treasure brought north through Baldur's Gate is mingled with coins, jewels, and magical items looted from half a hundred towns too weak to defend themselves against the Cult of the Dragon. Around the horde are shards of icicles that fell during the castle's impact, breaking off the roof of the cavern like icy stalactites. Some look to have been as large as an oxcart.

The treasure hoard is frozen in ice. Melting it requires many fire spells or a long wait with a reliable fire source, but a single character can spend the day chipping away at the ice and roll once on the DMG "Treasure Hoard: Challenge 0-4" table.
## Araevin's Research
### Black Dragon Mask
See [Black Dragon Mask](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/black-dragon-mask)
Araevin's assessment:
- A strange item...initially thought it might be a relic of the Dragonfall Wars, yet it's obviously designed for a human. Then again, it seems to be older than the Cult of the Dragon, at least as far as Araevin is aware.
- This mask allows the wearer to assume properties of a Black Dragon, but it's clear that there were once others, perhaps for other kinds of dragons. Further, Araevin got the distinct sense that this item as it is now is in a...fragmented state. That is, there was once only **one** mask. Its ability to change form reflects this.
- It's clear why a human would want this: it grants a significant boon towards interacting with Dragons, who are powerful allies. 
### Hazirawn
See [Hazirawn](../../npcs/hazirawn.md)
Araevin's assessment:
- A relic of Old Netheril, likely forged at the height of the Empire. Such things are worth their weight in gold, and utterly priceless to collectors, but this one would make all but the greediest arcanists wary because of its horrible history.
- The soul inside that blade was bound **willingly**, as one of the great military commanders of the Empire. It had one purpose in life, and it maintains the same purpose now for eternity: killing.
- It emits a strong aura of necrotic magic now, but if it attunes to a willing wielder, its power more than doubles.
- Reveals all properties of the item.
### Globe of Force
Araevin's assessment:
- Target of a _resilient sphere_ spell made permanent, likely by whoever wielded these smithing tools. The Cold Hand soldier who brought it mentioned something about Giants aboard the castle; were they smiths?
- Was able to defeat the enchantment using a _disintegrate_ spell, after some careful study.
