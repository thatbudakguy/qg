# Scenes
## Phlan
### Denlor's Tower / Araevin's News
- council celebrates the death of Arauthator, but is divided about how to address the threat of dragons patrolling the Well. 
- if anyone inquires about GKC, he will tell them his theory about where the parts return to
- if Gensor's wooden box is opened/picked, the magical trap inflicts 2d4 necrotic damage and permanently blackens/shrivels the skin on the one who opens it (DC 15 CON save for half). A _lesser restoration_, _remove curse_, etc. removes the effect on the hands.
- Inside the box is correspondence between Gensor and Denlor, written in Loross (so it uses Draconic alphabet but isn't Draconic). The gang have seen this before on Rezmir's sword Hazirawn, as well as in Denlor's personal journal.
### Audience with the Lord Regent
- Aleyd comes to summon them to Stojanow Keep for dinner with Brahms
- Brahms wants to know whether he should capitulate
- He's facing pressure:
	- Out-of-work sailors and longshoremen are stirring up trouble
	- Merchant families are breathing down his neck
	- Goods from Hillsfar (wood) and Melvaunt (iron, copper) are becoming scarce.
- The Daoran dynasty was far too proud to bend the knee to Mulmaster, ever, but the last Daoran died in an accident. Maybe it's time for change.
- The Thayan Galley anchored offshore brought a copy of the charter for Brahms to sign. He has it to show to the Gang. He told them he'd decide by the end of the month. In return, they offered to take all the town's criminals with them back to Mulmaster to face justice.
