# todo
- witchthorn stuff

# announcements
- move 11/17 session one day back?

# recap
- arrived at mooncrescent tower, in the rain, at dusk. on a hill rising up from what was a blighted forest, a white tower like a chess piece.
- from far away, nilshai floating up and down to an open platform 40ft up in the air in the tower with telescopes. crystal signal indicates up.
- examined moss-covered standing stones, but hagar was seen and nilshai descended. snuck into lobby, door was open.
- in the lobby was a book on a lectern in the center. Declan read it and activated a lightning trap.
- up the stairs spiraling around the outside, a wooden door. Calcey picked it and unexpectedly appeared at the platform behind nilshai.
- calcey snuck to door at midway point of room and picked it, but it too was trapped. alarm goes off, nilshai gets shot off the platform, gang pile into dark room.
- doom raiders, looking beat up, are here.

# intro q

# mooncrescent tower

see locations/mooncresent-tower.md.

meditation room: hemispherical room, but very dark. floor is strangely lifelike, soft grasses that are pure white, waving in invisible wind. the ceiling is invisible; instead it looks like semi-familiar stars (but some are...wrong).

the nilshai are waiting to ambush whoever comes out of the room. There are four with spells readied: black tentacles, blight, slow, etc. they blink out off the platform if engaged in melee.

## doom raiders 

- Istrid is badly wounded. She needs medical attention.
- They just want to escape unscathed, but they'll try to make the gang promise to get them out in exchange for information (and ideally let them take some of the books from upstairs too).
- They managed to get in and didn't fall for the trap on the first floor (LOL that the gang are suffering from obvious lightning), but they were caught by the Nilshai in the library one floor above. Rather than risk damage to the books, they surrendered.
- They don't have weapons. These were taken and are being stored in a locked trunk out on the platform, which also has a _blight_ _glyph of warding_ on it with an _arcane lock_.
- They suspect that Morthil is, or was, a lich. After their many years together of clearing out lich dooms, this has the hallmarks of an early stage one: some writings in the lobby, plus the selection of books in the library...especially what looked like a _Tome of the Stilled Tongue_.
- Since this was once a society, they think Morthil would have hidden the place where he experimented and ultimately sought undeath: such work would be unseemly and couldn't risk being discovered. It's here, but it'll be well concealed.
