## Opening
Message from Araevin:
- Cult isn't attacking Evereska. Instead, some dragons are giving their lives to create a _Mythal_ to protect the Well for the return of Tiamat. They know we'll challenge them, so they want to make it impossible for us.
- I've observed them. At the rate they're going, they'll be able to construct a _Mythal_ that will make it impossible for even the greatest army the Realms have ever seen to penetrate the Well within 30 days. We have to assemble the crystal before that happens.
	- Characteristics of the mythal??
	- Or it's already been raised, and now they're trying to build Tiamat's temple without the Red Wizards and without a mask, which is going slowly but surely.
- I've spoken with all of the Hill Elders, and their opinion is unanimous. We have to mount an attack. Evereska will join under three conditions: we have to assemble the crystal. we have to have a plan to do something about the dragons. And we have to have the support of Evermeet...Declan, we have to talk to your mother. 
	- Convince Ilsevele to lead a second crusade; visit the grave of Seiveril
