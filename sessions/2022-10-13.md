# Scenes
## Roarke House
> You spill out of the teleportation circle and into the warm common room of Roarke House, with its ornately carved duskwood interior depicting stars and moons. The four disheveled servants from Talis the White's hunting lodge stare in mute fascination, disoriented. At the sudden commotion, the elderly halfling butler Madrak shuffles into the room, showing no sign of alarm at the motley crew that has just been deposited inside his house. "Mr. Peregrine, Miss Calcey, Mr. Declan, Mr. Hagar. Lord Neverember is presently in his study. If you and your guests would be so kind as to wait here?"

who are the humans from the hunting lodge?

gastyn, chief butler to lord marsten of Parnast.
arlaenga, head maid
angrath woodwise, chief hunter to Talis the White.
eldon lanik, chief groom

all used to be servants of Lord Marsten, noble who owned the lodge who the cult killed.

Renaer and Madrak arrive and Renaer offers jobs to any of the survivors who will take them.

### Talking with Renaer
Renaer's updates:

**the bad**:
- Every gossip rag in the city is speculating about whatever thunder rocked Waterdeep two days ago. People are on edge, and petty crime has spiked. Animals are behaving strangely. Do you know anything about it?
- Dagult is in the city representing Neverwinter, and he's already threatening to take over leadership of the special council. Renaer is working on securing Open Lord Laeral Silverhand's support to counterbalance him, but it's been tough without some heroes here to lend their voices.
- The Southern realms of Tethyr, Amn, and Calimshan have not committed their support. The Calishite nobility felt they weren't adequately rewarded for their contributions at Kryptgarden, and the other realms haven't suffered from Dragon attacks.
- "Your friend the Monk and his unfortunate student" are staying at the Ulbrinter Villa with the Harpers. The Harpers haven't fully committed their support to scouts and spies on the ground against the Cult, but they're working on it.
- Nothing from the Black Network...been trying to get ahold of the representatives in the city (the Doom Raiders?) to no avail. We'll be lucky if they aren't working against us...

**the good**:
- Baldur's gate, silverymoon, and Cormyr have all sent delegates who are staying in the city now awaiting the signal to convene.
- The Wild Elves and High Elves of Faerun have sent delegates representing them as well.
- The Dwarves of the North have sent a delegate all the way from Mithral Hall! The last time a council of humans, dwarves, and elves convened has to have been centuries ago.
- The Order of the Gauntlet and Emerald Enclave have sent representatives. Although nobody knows who the Enclave guy is...or what he looks like... 

> [!QUESTION] Can you commit to a date and time to report to a secret council at the Lord's Palace?

## Dock Ward
- Peregrine goes to find the hideout.

> [!QUESTION] How does it feel to be back here? What are you thinking about?

## Ulbrinter Villa
- Leosin and Sirge are here, off of Delzorin Street and Windborne Way. Leosin has been in contact with Ontharr, asking him to send an Order delegation to the council.
- House known for shipping and shipwrights. Crest is a ship on a green sea with a sail bearing a heart on it.
- If visited, the PCs can meet Remi, as well as the HAWKs (it's currently a somewhat full house). Also 24 guards and 6 servants.
- Nomus Ulbrinter is a former sea captain and patriarch of the house, although he left management of it to his son and daughter-in-law long ago. He mostly reads in his study.

## Silmerhelve Villa
- A large, three-story building similar to Roarke House, in the Sea Ward on Chasso's Trot between Copper Street and the High Road.
- The Silmerhelves retain a 
- The entrance faces into a long, high hallway crowded with the portraits of former members of the house. Oddly, the number of mirrors on the walls nearly matches the number of paintings and portraits, creating a strange "house of mirrors effect".

> [!WARNING] Everyone makes a perception check.

Better than a 15 sees, for a brief second:
- The face of a beautiful woman wearing a long, shimmering copper dress, peering out oddly
- A high mountain peak covered in snow
- The face on a portrait shift and morph from a bearded man into a regal-looking woman, her eyes following you

### Meeting Dala
Dala receives everyone in a drawing room full of beautiful art and priceless mounted artifacts, including several obviously magical weapons.

What Dala will reveal, if she is suitably impressed by Peregrine or someone else:
- The item that made the sound is the *Draakhorn*, an ancient artifact of immense power.
- It dates back to the Age of Dragons, when Dragons battled Giants for supremacy of the realms.
- All dragons will hear its call, signifying danger, and eventually, they will be compelled to heed it.

Dala won't reveal her source or discuss her patron, but she agrees to tell the council what she knows if the Gang can get her into the secret session (there are rumors that a special council is being convened, but nobody knows where). She will only reveal the information to Lady Laeral Silverhand herself, the Open Lord.
## Draakhorn sounds again
