## Bang
> The forms of two Stone Giants, together in death, are crumpled in a heap at the lower end of the room. Their wide eyes and gaping mouths depict the horror of an inescapable doom. The smell of smoke and death from elsewhere in the castle drifts freely in and out of the room's open archways along with the early morning mist. Sitting in the center of the room, and bolted into the icy floor, is a huge cauldron large enough to boil a medium-sized creature, strange runes covering its surface. Near the bodies of the giants rests a massive and dented metal chest, easily six feet long and four feet wide. One of the Vale Guard soldiers shrugs apologetically. "We haven't been able to get it open..."

Once the PCs head back to ground, [Trueshot](../../npcs/kinyon-colbathin.md) and a team of 5 of the Cold Hand will accompany them to try to get to level 2, though they aren't aware of a way to do it yet.
