plus cave ambience on watch2gether
## Background
-   There’s a noticeable increase in the populations of bats, rats, and wolves in the region.
-   Plants within 500 feet of the lair wither, and their stems and branches become twisted and thorny.
-   Shadows cast within 500 feet of the lair seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move as though alive.
-   A creeping fog clings to the ground within 500 feet of the vampire’s lair. The fog occasionally takes eerie forms, such as grasping claws and writhing serpents.
## Areas
### Entrance
### Mythal room
The room containing the Mythal Stone was protected by a powerful ward, but once Sandesyl realized what was concealed in the room, she abducted Mithriel Summergale in order to obtain entrance.

### 

## Mythal
- the mythal was raised by several (3) high mages who gave their lives during a ritual of complement
- when mithriel attempts to alter the mythal, she influences these spirits using the power from the souls of the dead elves
- declan has to engage in some sort of content of wits/arcane lore with these spirits, and his body is catatonic, in order to reverse the changes to the mythal
- mithriel is able to remove the prohibition against dragons, so it is a race against time to re-add this as the cult forces are nearing the meadow wall

## Battle
### Skyreach Assault
During the battle, the cult will be simultaneously attempting to recapture the treasure from Skyreach Castle in the Vine Vale.
	- on initiative count 20, roll a d6.
	- on a 1-4, tick one segment on the skyreach battle clock (8 segments).
	- on a 5, do nothing.
	- on a 6, remove one segment from the clock.
	- if the Vale Guard and Cold Hand were alerted to the Cult's arrival prior to the battle, do nothing on a roll of 4 and 5. they are still outgunned by the dragons, but in a better defensive position.
