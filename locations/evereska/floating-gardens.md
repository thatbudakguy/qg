# Floating Gardens
## Appearance

## Background
So named because they are surrounded entirely by the Singing Waters, which emerge from the ground of Evereska and disappear back into it, the Gardens are effectively the greatest temple to the Seldarine in the city. All worship is welcome here, but Rillifane Rallathil has a special place, especially during High Huntress Riverwall's tenure in that position. Those who are suffering from ailments and seeking help also visit the Gardens, where priests tend to them. Others may visit on occasion to pay priests to conduct ceremonies for various purposes.

Unlike the rest of the city, the Gardens are not mostly high off the ground in the boughs of trees: instead, everything is at ground level, creating the impression of a huge glade carpeted in soft moss. Meandering paths crisscross small islands within the Singing Waters, the smallest of which may contain only a single bush or tree, while the largest house wooden shrines and other buildings dedicated to worship of the Seldarine.
## Areas
The Singing Waters are said to cure all ailments, and many who have taken ill rest in the House of Cedars, a place of relaxation tended by the clergy of Rillifane Rallathil. KIYOMIZU DIPPERS
