## Scenes
### Tower of Arcane Might
- courtyard = authorized vendors only who sell foods, etc. entrance door protected by golems. 10ft stone wall with ward atop it. vendors enter in morning and exit at night.
- dungeon = storehouse. literal gold is stored here, as well as magical items. trapped as fuck
- first floor = library. lots of forbidden magical tomes, etc. warded. tomes are chained to shelf.
- second floor = dormitories. gensor doesn't sleep anymore, so need to go here. basic kitchens but most people use the vendors.
- third floor = laboratories. high-ranking cloaks get their own, low-ranking work for high-ranking. gensor has his own at the top of the tower. extremely trapped.
- sigils of Cloaks grant access. when being admitted you inscribe your sigil on a magical plate that "teaches" it to the golems. plates stored in special part of library. carrying an item with the sigil then serves as a sort of passkey.
### Tower of the Wyvern
- marble with ornate stained glass windows; biggest one is high up and has a wyvern on it
- dungeons: the palace of revels. baths, exhibition stages, leisure chambers, etc. also accessible from tower of the blades
- palace of revels now used as lair and storehouse for the hangmen/xorack
### Tower of the Blades
- huge castle with many towers. all 16 blades are required by law to live here; their families, servants, bodyguards, etc. are literally all hostage to each other.
- 300 soldiers (guards) and 30 cloaks guard it. 6-man crews with one cloak at all the entrances.
- the noble's individual wings are warded by the cloaks.
- fucktons of secret passages, etc. dungeons connect to sewers as well as palace of revels.
### Southroad Keep
- super old fieldstone from the Earthspur mountains, noticeably older and simpler than other towers. just a giant circular building
- HQ for city watch and tax collectors, courts, prison.
- Crowded, with long and slow lines.
- dungeons: prison
- first floor: courts, registration of visitors (e.g. magic users)
- second floor: city watch and governmental offices
- top floors: tax collector offices
- 100 soldiers
### Docks Quarter
- sprawling district encompassing loading docks, shipyards, and wharfs that is plagued by crime 
- man-made bridges traverse a network of canals that penetrate deeper into the city
- has the Lighthouse, a 150-ft tower with _continual light_ spell that guides ships into the often foggy Bay of Mulmaster
### Imperial District
- houses all three of the towers as well as the Thayan Embassy
- highest-up point in the city 
### Zhent Quarter
- original home turf of the Hangmen
- Outside the old city walls
- much of it was burned or razed during the recent raid.
### Thayan Enclave
- embassy is here
- Khazark Tola Zurn dwells in the embassy
### Traveller's Cloak Inn
- one of the nicer establishments in town, but rooms are quite steep (12gp per night).
- extremely well-appointed, drinks & food use foreign spices, etc.
- showing a Cloak's sigil will get you free room & board for a night
- frequent by Hawks, incl. Groshin Lor
- Salvar is dressed in the garb of the Cloaks, but appears nervous, picking at his food and flicking his eyes between a journal that sits open in front of him and other people in the room. He sizes up the party, looks to the door, looks at other cloaks, etc.
- Groshin, by contrast, is utterly relaxed, yet has chosen what is very obviously the most secure seat in the building, in a rear corner with excellent view of nearly the entire building. He has strange paint below his eyes. Occasionally people come over to his table to speak with him in a low voice and he will smile, nod, etc. Other hawks sit with him.
### Salvar
- sassy, somewhat flamboyant voice? prone to staring off in space, heavy sighs, etc. gets a little teary when talking about cyprian.
- reminds the party that they need to register if they're staying.
- is both noble (mother Desona Brix is a blade) and a cloak. his family name got him far, but not far enough to conceal his obvious lack of talent.
- knows that Thurndan was out conducting sea trials of the _Lady Dmitra_. pissed that he was not invited to be on the ship's maiden voyage. heard about blood on decks? Ship returned ahead of schedule, probably because of the violence in the Zhent Quarter?
- former boyfriend Cyprian Balefrost was the one working closely with Gensor in the lab who figured out that the thing used in the scale model of the weapon was the GKC. Cyprian knows about Nar Kerymhoarth, where the Daemonfey were locked away, so he figured out that Gensor had gone there and found the shard (but doesn't know why the shard was there).
- has been staking out the Traveller's Cloak to try to overhear or catch a sign that one of the Cloaks here was the one who betrayed Cyprian.
- will talk to the PCs, but not unless it's in the safety of a room or someplace outside the inn.
- has Cyprian's notes because he left them with Salvar ("I just feel like he was trying to tell me something!"), but can't get access to Cyprian's personal effects, which are stored in a safe that only opens using his personal seal in the Tower of Arcane Might.
- Thinks Declan looks a bit like Cyprian...Cyprian was a _sorcerer_. He had _dragon blood_. (he starts crying)
### Rusty Chock Tavern
### Flagship _Lady Dmitra_
#### Boarding
- she's got a special slip in the north docks because it's the only one that can fit her. nearly 250ft long from bowsprit to stern.
- guarded by three units of 5 soldiers x 1 cloak at all times (bow, stern, onboard). she is not crewed while in port. High Blade Drakehorn is the captain, so she only leaves port when the High Blade is aboard.
- getting on board is a skill challenge.
##### Skill Challenge
- Objective: get on board. 
- Check type: stealth
- 3/5 fill up the difficulty meter (DC 19).
- Two on displacement. You get separated while trying to avoid the patrols.
- Three on indiscretion. The ship is tightly guarded by patrols of soldiers and cloaks, and is magically warded to detect intruders. You trigger a guard device.
- Two on injury. The patrols are ordered to attack first and ask questions later. You get burned and stabbed.
- One on affliction. A magical ward or other effect casts a debilitating spell on one of you.
### Interior
- hold (1): food stores, armory, brig, bilge
- lower deck (2): cabins, galley, head, navigation room
- main deck (3): bridge (raised), armored forecastle (raised, has reality weapon)
The forecastle is protected by thick lead armor plates, and the area around the weapon has manacles that are chained to the deck with grates to flush blood out through the sides of the ship.
### Sewers
#### Adventuring
- Characters can use the sewers to attempt to travel to underneath any location within the boundaries of the City Walls.
- Characters travel at a pace of 2 miles per hour, which is the "slow" pace listed in the DMG. Attempting to travel faster is possible, but you will be automatically surprised.
- The city is 10 miles from northernmost point to southernmost point.
- Every hour spent in the sewers calls for an encounter check. Roll any die; odds are an encounter and evens are nothing.
- Any time a character enters the sewer water, they must make a DC 14 CON saving throw or be poisoned for 1 day. A character that succeeds in this save doesn't need to make it again for that day.
