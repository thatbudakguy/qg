## Goals

### Get to the island

- enter from somewhere on Faerun, arrive at House of Cedars near Elion\
- you are among the handful of non-elves ever to come here. technically, it's a crime...
- overland journey to Leuthilspar. polymorph? teleportation doesn't really work here due to the mythal.

### Learn about the final shard of the Gatekeeper's Crystal

- the creation of evermeet was a mythal, just prior to the outbreak of the first crown war in ~-15,000 DR
- Uaul'Selu'Keryth "At War With the Weave"
- was intended to bring a part of Arvandor, the Elven heaven, to Toril for the elves
- the star elves eventually left as a result of this plan, having refused to participate, and instead took the opposite approach of retreating _away_ from toril into a separate plane they called "sildeyuir", which some say they captured from the first forest spirits of the old forests of the southeast.
- effects of the mythal reshaped the coast of Faerun because of the tsunami created when the island was raised from the sea.

### Convince the elves to join the fight against Tiamat

- what resources do the elves have to commit to the fight
  - Knights (heavy cavalry)
  - Spellarchers (infantry)
  - Priests of Corellon (support)
  - Mages of the Tower (support)
- how will they get to faerun and to the well of dragons
  - using the old portal network; araevin can assist with this if he stays
  - some portals would need to be reactivated to do it in time
  - they can be exfiltrated to faerun while the gang searches for the final shard

### Retrieve the Crownblade

- the blade (Ar'Cor'Kerym) was given to Ilsevele by the Srinshee in 1377 DR
- ilsevele hid it in the Summer Palace after her return to evermeet, formally renouncing her title as Coronal. this was partly done to avoid it falling into the hands of one of the other houses and ensure relative peace on the island.
- soldiers from house Veldann or Durothil will follow the gang discreetly to try to retrieve the blade for their own house or at least prevent the gang from getting it. one of them may reach the blade first and be killed by the bladerite; they may also kill each other in pursuit of it. they are technically forbidden to harm the outsiders, but things could get hairy...
- the blade is a powerful artifact that can only be wielded by the Coronal of Myth Drannor; picking it up or touching it results in the Bladerite being invoked. if you fail the bladerite, you are consumed by arcane fire and die within a minute.
- it has loregems mounted in its hilt that contain teh souls of elven high mages
- journey from leuthilspar to lake of dreams: two days?.

### Learn about Declan's past

- seiveril's crusade
  - the daemonfey attacked myth drannor, killing some of the most powerful mages of the time, including Araevin's friends
  - they gathered forces and retook the city of myth drannor, which had been abandoned centuries ago in the retreat to evermeet
  - ilsevele's father started a crusade back to faerun to retake the city, culminating in the recapture of myth drannor. they later called it the return
  - seiveril returned the spirit of his childhood hero, Starbrow, supposedly with corellon's blessing, to lead the crusade from arvandor
  - while araevin sought the pieces of the gatekeeper's crystal to keep it from the daemonfey, ilsevele and starbrow led her father's army and fell in love
  - seiveril died in the battle to retake myth drannor, and ilsevele became coronal with starbrow as her consort. she was given the ruler's blade by the Srinshee, a type of good Elven Lich called a Baelnorn, who was spiritually bound to the city of Myth Drannor. (1377 DR)

- the fall of myth drannor
  - ilsevele and starbrow ruled together in myth drannor for 100 years. but they gradually grew apart. starbrow was a warrior and felt purposeless with the end of seiveril's crusade. eventually, he begged to be returned to his family and his rest in arvandor.
  - in 1477 DR, on the hundredth anniversary of their marriage, Ilsevele granted his wish, returning starbrow to arvandor. she spent the following decade in increasing solitude, reflecting on her life and the choices she had made.
  - 1487 DR myth drannor is attacked by the city of Shade and falls. Ilsevele retreats to Evermeet and renounces her title as Coronal. She hides the Ruler's Blade in the Summer Palace.

- declan's father and origins
  - Arclath 


### Reunite Araevin and Ilsevele

- prophecy says something about the crown and losing her father?
- returning to the Crusader's Cenotaph at Corellon's Grove to pray for guidance
- What ilsevele wants:
  - an apology from araevin for choosing magic over her
  - forgiveness from Declan for having abandoned him to the Giants
  - to know that Araevin still loves her
- What araevin wants:
  - to know that Seiveril would have approved of his actions
  - to feel like an Elf again
  - to know that Ilsvele still loves him
  - to see Declan attain his full power as a Chosen of Mystra

## Locations

### House of Cedars:

- Araevin's ancestral home, a lodge on the Northern headlands of the island
- smells of cedar and woodsmoke, surprisingly rustic for an elven building
- a waterfall runs through the center of it
- portals that allow entrance from some places on the Mainland; they all belonged to old elven empires like Aryvandaar, Illefarn, and Cormanthyr
  - moonwood near silverymoon
  - cloakwood near baldur's gate
  - dalelands / cormanthor
  - reaching woods near berdusk (harpers; inactive â€“ needs Araevin to reactivate)
  - gray forest near Lyrabar; inactive (travel by sea to Veltalar, in aglarond)


### Leuthilspar

- capital city; built out of buildings "grown" from raw materials via magic and embedded with gems
- High Council (including matrons) meets at the Hall of the Ancients

#### High Council members

- Emardin Elsydar; High priest of Corellon
- Selsharra Durothil; sun elf matron of clan Durothil, a powerful isolationist. Long silver hair, wearing a circlet of silver and sapphires.
  - Controls the participation of the Knights and Spellarchers
- Ammisyll Veldann; sun elf governor of the city of Nimlith, opposed to the rule of the Coronal in general and a populist. Blonde hair in tight braids, wearing a large badge of office.
- High mage Breithel Olithir; moon elf archmage of Tower Reilloch, former mentor of Araevin. Magical black eye "eye of Labelas" truesight.
  - controls the participation of the mages, and whether they will cast spells powerful enough to transport the elves to Faerun

### Summer Palace

- alabaster building floating above the Lake of Dreams
- theurglass windows that become transparent when touched
- challenges:
  - it's floating in the air several hundred feet above a lake, and it moves around
  - it's really easy to fall off in a lot of locations
  - scrying magic to observe locations on the island is blocked by its mythal
  - it's guarded by the vault guardian (blade golem?), stealth is needed to not be noticed
    - can't be destroyed, but can be pushed off/out of the building??
    - ilsevele has a talisman that is supposed to bypass it (but it doesn't work)
  - the crownblade can't be touched without invoking the bladerite

### Grove of Corellon

- Many temples and shrines scattered throughout the woods, small and large, decorated with flowers, flags, and other offerings
- Presence of fey??
- Cenotaph of the Crusader: a giant granite standing stone erected to honor those who perished in Seiveril's crusade defending the elves of Faerun
