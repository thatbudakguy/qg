# mooncrescent tower

## background

Like Araevin, Morthil had distant demonic ancestry. Obsessed with magic that was lost to time during the Dawn Age, Morthil worshipped and eventually committed himself to Vecna, god of secrets and lichdom. It was Vecna who provided him the lost secrets of Elven High Magic needed to forge the Gatekeeper's Crystal â€“ and convinced him the true path to power lie in lichdom. The Mooncrescent order consisted of those faithful enough to try to follow him into lichdom...but they all failed.

After using the crystal to imprison Magnar, its shards were lost. Morthil sought it to use as his phylactery, intending to keep it in a secret shadow "copy" of his study forever, but never found it. But the crystal accidentally returned to the place it was forged...

## outside

> you followed the crystal's pull, pushing further and further from the center of sildeyuir into the far reaches of the demiplane, where twilight reigns. all around you see what the receding blight uncovered: ruined forests and empty elven citadels, their walls pitted and scarred as if by acid. other than avoiding the occasional nilshai patrol, you see only one other rider, from a great distance, and they never approach.

little light rain/clouds for some vibey here?

- on a hill surrounded by formerly blighted forest, clearly visible from a long ways away. commanding view of the surroundings.
- had been engulfed by blight, so trees and other plants are all dead, but in the two-day journey here already some things have begun to come back. a few pale green grasses have sprouted at the roots of the blackened trees.
- moss-covered standing stones outside that look like some might have writing, with the faintly visible outline of a circular courtyard. the ground inside the courtyard seems to be oddly bumpy.
- the tower itself appears totally unchanged, made of pale white stone smoothly curving upward about a hundred feet with no windows, like a queen chess piece. the platform opening is visible about 40ft up on one side, and there is a single 10-ft door made of dull gray stone at the base.
- door: leads to the _lobby_. it's heavy, but not trapped or locked. the nilshai never bothered with it.
- standing stones: **clue**. in archaic elvish, one has a fragmented "creed of the mooncrescent" which says "Our door is always open to the like-minded, just as the sky. Enter without fear; your test will be..."
- mounds: **clue**. burial mounds, of a type that sometimes indicate a mass grave. Peregrine can tell that this was once a graveyard.

## lobby
- circular room about 50 feet in diameter. high ceiling. marbled floor with a huge glittering moon inset into it. staircase that ascends around 1/3 the perimeter of the room up to a second floor; a further 1/3 is taken up by tall wooden curio cases filled with all sorts of strange trophies: . in the center, velvet couches arranged in a circle around an ornate wooden lectern with a book on it.
- book: a **trap** that the nilshai have not activated. DC 20 to notice the spell. the cover says "Elven High Magic" in common (but it will change depending on who looks at it). If read, casts _chain lightning_, 10d8 lightning dmg, then jump to other 3 targets, dex save for half. loud thunder sound. Nilshai will come down the stairs from the platform momentarily.
- stairs: lead up to the _platform_, with a locked wooden door at the top (DC 16 to pick). the stairs then continue circling around up to the _library_, which has a similar door that is also locked (same DC).

## platform
- hemispherical room with a low ceiling, where half of the curved wall (a quarter circle) is open to the elements, with a stone floor that extends 5ft out into a platform/shelf about 40ft in the air. the shelf has several different ornate silver telescopes of various sizes. two nilshai are here making strange fluting sounds and spinning, and one is "using" a telescope. The non-curved wall has a simple wooden door in the center.
- nilshai: they're having an argument about whether the prisoner has been weakened enough to bring him back to the border ethereal yet.
- telescopes: they seem to have contained a great many gems at one time, but have been  stripped. one still has **treasure**: a ruby the size of a grape in it worth 1500gp. the one the nilshai is using is focused, from a great distance but with perfect clarity, on the Deirr citadel.
- door: has an _arcane lock_  set by the nilshai. DC 26 to pick and/or break. also has a _glyph of warding_ **trap** that activates if the door is touched; casts _blight_. leads to the _meditation room_.

## meditation room
- hemispherical room, but very dark. floor is strangely lifelike, soft grasses that are pure white, waving in invisible wind. the ceiling is invisible; instead it looks like semi-familiar stars (but some are...wrong). someone is playing a lute softly.
- the doom raiders are here. they used up their _wish_ spells getting here and are out of luck, but they know the crystal is at the top.

## library
- Circular room about 40ft in diameter, with huge 15-ft bookcases encircling the room.  At the top of the bookcases is a narrow second floor balcony encircling the room, and another floor of bookcases that are about 10ft tall. At the far end, a fixed ladder goes up to the second floor, then continues up to what looks like a hatch in the ceiling.
- books: in every language, of every kind and size. A movable ladder can rotate around the full room to access any book. At the far end of the room at the top of the shelf is **treasure**: a glass case with a lock containing three ornate books finished in gold (_Tome of Understanding_), silver with (_Tome of Clear Thought_), and bronze (_Tome of Leadership and Influence_). The lock is trivially pickable, but it has a poison needle **trap** with basilisk poison (DC 15 CON save) that inflicts paralysis on failure; _poisoned_ until long rest on success. As soon as one book is chosen, the others vanish.
- second floor: more books, but weirder. some look like they might be bound with strange skins, and some appear to still have hair and teeth attached?? One of them actually has a dessicated _tongue_ pinned to the front cover. The first few pages are filled with indecipherable wizard scrawl, but the rest are blank..._legend lore_ or another spell would reveal a **clue**: this is one of the _Tomes of the Stilled Tongue_, said to have been created from the tongues of spellcasters who crossed Vecna. 

## study
- Circular room 20ft in diameter, with a high ceiling. On the left, a garguantuan desk 8 feet across and 10 feet high with shelves full of scrolls and quills and covered in a shower of parchment is pushed up against the wall. The right side of the room is dominated by a metal table about 5 feet long, covered in dark stains and scratches, with several metal containers and tools resting on it, along with a small, intricate piece of art. In the center is a stone plinth with what looks like a real crystal ball inset in the top.
- desk: drowning in a sea of parchment written in a spidery Elvish hand, breathlessly describing strange events: a great tree falling alone in the forest, the creation of a planet in deep space, the morning washing ritual of an unnamed woman in Waterdeep.
- crystal ball: it's **treasure**; a real crystal ball! you can cast scrying without expending a spell slot when you use it.
- table: full of rusted blades and metal containers. The stains look like blood. The "art piece" is a few inches on each side, radiates magic, and is flecked with more blood. On closer inspection it looks almost like a labyrinth, or a strange collection of angular containers fused together into a square grid. Each has a hole in the top, as though they were separate chambers. At the edges are inscribed tiny numerals, one for each row and column of the grid. This is an easy "aquarium puzzle" that teleports everyone in the room to the _secret study_ when completed.

## study (secret)
- Completely dark. This room is a dark 'echo' of the _study_: a windowless, cylindrical chamber with gently sloping floor that goes to a drain, 20ft in diameter. The same metal table is on the right side of the room, but with only two objects resting on it: another metal art piece, and a wicked-looking dagger. The plinth in the center of the room is occupied by a long, oily-looking and angular shard of a peculiar metal: the Gatekeeper's Crystal.
- **trap**: touching the crystal activates a sickening radiance-esque globe; 4d10 necrotic each round + 1 lvl of exhaustion each rd (DC 14 CON save for half and no exhaust).
- you can use the other shards of the crystal to temporarily block this effect; doing so requires a DC 20 arcana check while holding all the shards.
- puzzle: needs to be deactivated while clock is ticking; you can only make one move per round. This is a "normal" aquarium puzzle. finishing it returns you to the _study_.
- dagger: **treasure**: _Afterthought_, Vecna's dagger, +5 unholy dagger with an eyeball embedded in the hilt that looks at you when you pick it up. A rich, deep voice greets you and offers to show you something.
