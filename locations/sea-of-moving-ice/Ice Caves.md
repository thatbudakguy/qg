Beneath the village lies a network of ice caves inhabited by Arauthator and his minions. Two entrances lead into the caves from the village: one hidden inside the meeting hall and the other inside the shaman's hut. The dragon enters the caves by way of underwater tunnels that connect to his lair chamber, but these are too deep and well hidden to be used by the adventurers.

> ### Ice Toads
>Arauthator has attracted a number of ice toads to Oyaviggaton, where they help to maintain the iceberg and the dragon's many treasures and trophies. The ice toads are good at this job, thanks to their exceptionally intelligent leader, **Marfulb**.
>Feeding on seals, sea birds, and fish caught for them by the Ice Hunters, Oyaviggaton's ice toads are not automatically hostile to strangers. Once characters get inside Arauthator's lair, they might find that these creatures can be helpful to their quest. Ice toads normally speak only their own obscure language. Those in Oyaviggaton know a little Draconic and Uluik (the language of the Ice Hunters), but their accents are thick and their pronunciation atrocious. **Marfulb** is fluent in Draconic thanks to many hours spent conversing with Arauthator.
>When the characters encounter ice toads, their intelligence won't be apparent until they act or attempt to speak. Even then, characters might not recognize the ice toads' croaking as language. Ice toads move on all fours, but their webbed front feet are surprisingly dexterous. Some carry tools and useful items in pouches slung around their necks.

## General Features

With its caverns carved out of the glacial depths of the iceberg, every surface in Oyaviggaton is made of ice.

***Ceilings and Walls.*** Most passages in the ice caves are at least 15 feet wide, and ceilings are 20 feet high unless noted otherwise. The walls are intricately carved with draconic imagery, pillars, cornices, filigrees, buttresses, leering dragon faces, and other decorative flourishes. This work has been done by kobolds in Arauthator's service, and its quality varies widely.

***Floors.*** The floors inside the iceberg are worn glass-smooth from decades of traffic. Arauthator, the ice trolls, and the ice toads move across the slick ice with ease thanks to claws and bony spurs on their feet that give them traction. The dragon's kobold servants wear crampons made of animal teeth strapped to their feet. Characters without crampons or the ability to walk on ice treat all areas of the ice caves as difficult terrain. A successful DC 10 Intelligence check allows a character to rig a set of crampons from items in a climbing kit, or to convert a pair of kobold-sized crampons to fit a Medium creature. Snowshoes are of no help inside the iceberg.

There are no stairs inside the iceberg; the floor slopes between areas of different elevation. Characters can slide down a one-level ramp with ease. Sliding down a two-level ramp (for example, from area 10 to area 9) is automatic if the character is sitting, but requires a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check if the character tries to slide down while standing. Characters equipped with crampons cannot stand, but can treat ramps as difficult terrain. Moving along a two-level ramp with crampons also requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Characters without crampons can climb a one-level ramp with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, or can climb a two-level ramp with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Acrobatics is of no use to these checks, but using a climber's kit grants advantage on the checks. Any failed Dexterity check to move on a ramp results in the character sliding to the bottom of the ramp and falling prone.

***Light.*** The interior of Oyaviggaton is filled with dim light by whale-oil lamps that are kept filled and lit by the kobolds. The light is for the benefit of the ice toads, who are the only residents of the caves who need light to see.

***Temperature.*** The ice caverns are cold, with the temperature in most chambers hovering around 20 degrees Fahrenheit. The white dragons, the ice trolls, and the ice toads don't mind the cold. The kobolds and **Maccath the Crimson** bundle up in furs and warm their living quarters with small stoves that burn whale oil supplied by the villagers. As long as the characters wear proper cold weather gear, they are at no risk from the cold while in the ice caves.

***Visibility.*** The ice caves are open to the sea, creating banks of vapor that roll constantly through Oyaviggaton's corridors and chambers. This fog is more common in the low points of the caverns. In areas noted as +10 feet on the map, visibility is unrestricted unless a patch of random fog is encountered. In areas noted as 0 feet, visibility is limited to 75 feet. In areas noted as–10 feet or–20 feet, visibility is limited to 45 feet.

## Random Encounters

In addition to the inhabitants noted in specific areas, the adventurers might run into Arauthator's minions in any corridor or empty chamber. Whenever the characters move from a chamber into the circular corridor, or from the corridor into a chamber with no occupants, roll a d6. On a roll of 1, an encounter occurs. Then roll on the table to determine the specifics.

## Ice Caves Encounters

| d10 | Encounter or Event      |
|:---:|-------------------------|
| 1–2 | Fog                     |
| 3–5 | **Kobolds** (3d6)       |
| 6–8 | **Ice toads** (1d6)     |
|  9  | **Maccath the Crimson** |
| 10  | **Ice trolls** (1d2)    |

## Fog

The air is suddenly filled with roiling vapor. Visibility is reduced to 5 feet for 2 minutes or until the characters move 90 feet away.

## Kobolds

Arauthator brought a pack of unwitting kobolds to Oyaviggaton generations ago, and the creatures have been serving him in the frigid cold ever since. In the event of an encounter, a squad of 3d6 **kobolds** is working in or passing through the area. If the characters are dressed as Ice Hunter villagers or are wearing some other appropriate disguise, the kobolds eye them warily but don't immediately sound an alarm. Make a single Wisdom check for the kobolds with a DC equal to the lowest of the characters' checks to disguise themselves. The kobolds' Wisdom modifier is–2, but they have advantage on this check because of their numbers. If the check is successful (or if the characters aren't disguised), the kobolds launch a single volley of sling stones at the intruders, then flee in as many directions as possible to report the intrusion to the ice toads or ice trolls.

## Ice Toads

A crew of 1d6 **ice toads** (see *appendix D*) is working in this area or passing along the corridor. Disguises are ineffective against the ice toads, which know what creatures live in Oyaviggaton at any given time. If they see anything unexpected—even Ice Hunter villagers entering the caves without permission—they stop what they're doing and observe the characters' actions, asking questions if they can. The ice toads flee to the ice trolls if threatened, fighting only if they must.

The ice toads speak their own language, plus enough Draconic and Uluik to communicate with Arauthator, the kobolds, and the Ice Hunters. They work for Arauthator but have no special devotion to the dragon. If a fight is coming, their loyalty goes to whomever they expect to win. That means the dragon, unless the characters somehow impress them.

## Maccath the Crimson

Maccath often wanders the ice caves, deep in thought. On meeting strangers, her reaction is oddly subdued. See area 10 for more details on Maccath's situation.

## Ice Trolls

Encountered singly or in small roving gangs, **ice trolls** are ordinary trolls with bluish skin and immunity to cold damage. Unless any ice toads are nearby to intervene, the ice trolls treat any creature not a kobold, an ice toad, Maccath, or an Ice Hunter as an intruder. For more information on the ice trolls working for Arauthator, see area 12.

[img/adventure/RoT/009-map-10-1-arauthators-iceberg.jpg](Map 10.1: Arauthator's Iceberg and Lair)[img/adventure/RoT/010-map-10-1-arauthators-iceberg-player.jpg]((Player Version))
## Ice Caves (areas 1-7)

### 1. Entrance from Hut

Inside the hut of the shaman Bonecarver, old furs heaped atop poles are laid across an opening leading down to the ice caves. Steps are cut into the wall of the chute, creating steep, icy stairs that drop down 100 feet in a tight spiral. Because this entrance is seldom used, the steps become increasingly obscured by frost as the characters descend. At the 40-foot mark, a character must attempt a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to maintain a grip on the dangerously uneven footholds. Failure means the character loses his or her footing, sliding and tumbling 60 feet to the bottom and taking 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage. Characters can mitigate this danger by roping themselves together or using a climber's kit. Past the 40-foot mark, the steps improve again so that no further checks are necessary.

The chute and its icy stairs end at the ceiling. A sturdy ladder then descends into the approximate center of a rectangular chamber. The exit to the corridor is an icy, 15-foot-wide passageway sloping downward.

The chamber is empty except for a dozen baskets woven from leather strips and walrus ribs, stacked in the north corner. These contain frozen fish and a few skin-wrapped bundles of rotting shark meat that the Ice Hunters consider a delicacy.

### 2. Entrance from the Village Hall

Hidden beneath the planks in the back corner of the village hall, this entrance to the ice caves consists of a chute carved with icy stairs descending 100 feet in a tight spiral. This route is used regularly to bring supplies to Arauthator's minions, so the steps are clear and easy to climb. Supplies are carried down strapped to villagers' backs, or lowered in baskets with the pulley and rope in the village hall.

This chamber is empty except for three bundles of rolled-up sealskins sitting where the ladder descends from the chute above to the approximate center of the room. Additionally, a bed of piled furs has been arranged in the southwest corner, from which the sound of loud coughing can be heard when the characters enter the chamber. Villagers who suffer disease or injury beyond Bonecarver's limited healing ability are quarantined here in the relative warmth of the caves. The coughing villager is named **Mend-nets** (**tribal warrior**).

**Mend-nets** is naturally suspicious of strangers, but if any character can use *lesser restoration* to cure his disease, he becomes a trustworthy ally. He won't do anything to hurt the village or the tribe, but he hates the kobolds who live in the caves. The ice toads likewise repulse him, though they also ignore him. The ice trolls terrify him, and he has awoken several times to find a troll hungrily peering at him from the tunnel leading to the trolls' lair (area 12). He tells the characters that the creatures of the caves have been warned of their presence, but the only chambers he knows anything about besides this one are areas 1, 3, and 7.

### 3. Larder

The supplies that the villagers provide for Arauthator and his minions are stored here—mostly dried and frozen fish, whale, seal, walrus, and giant squid, plus furs that the kobolds fashion into protective clothing. Fish organs, shells, bones, soft stone, and other sundries are stored in smaller quantities, and are used by the ice toads to make ink, brushes, parchment, and other items for their work. A few seemingly inexplicable items are stored away from the other supplies, including a single steel gauntlet, a silver brooch containing a cameo, the brass hilt of a dueling knife, and a decorative belt buckle—bits and pieces that the villagers have pulled from the stomachs of sharks or giant octopi that have fed on explorers lost to the Sea of Moving Ice.

Also stockpiled in this chamber are coils of rope, spikes, and a few pulleys. It's clear at a glance that this gear has come from the south and was not made by the Ice Hunters. The kobolds use this equipment when something—or someone—needs to be lowered down into Arauthator's lair through area 6. The pulley is attached to the iron hook in the ceiling of that chamber.

### 4. Kobolds' Den

Arauthator's kobold servants live in this chamber.

>A dozen kobolds occupy this disheveled and filthy chamber. Half-eaten fish heads and gnawed seal flippers are tossed into corners or carelessly strewn around matted heaps of furs, which would undoubtedly smell as bad as they look if not for the cold.

The chamber holds 12 **kobolds** when the characters enter. A few are sleeping but most are tossing knucklebones, sharpening blades, sewing clothing, carving whalebone, or picking on each other. See "Random Encounters" (above) for guidelines on how the kobolds respond to intruders.

If the characters spend a few minutes searching the area, a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check suggests that approximately two dozen kobolds live in this chamber.

#### Treasure

Their only possessions of value are a number of walrus tusks carved with draconic imagery, six of which are of sufficient artistry to fetch 200 gp each from a suitable collector.

### 5. Junk Room

The kobolds throw their litter, food scraps, waste, worn-out boots, and other useless junk into this cavernous chamber. Its pit-like floor is filled to a depth of several feet, courtesy of minions that have been serving Arauthator in this iceberg for centuries. The trash floor of the chamber can be safely traversed, but there is nothing of value here.

### 6. The Chute

This narrow cavern is the access point to the lair of Arauthator below.

>This chamber feels far colder than any area of the ice caves you've explored so far. The cold issues from a yawning pit in the floor that twists down into darkness, and above which a heavy iron hook is anchored in the ice of the ceiling. A five-foot-wide walkway extends around both sides of the pit, connecting this entrance to an exit across the room. Carved into the ice of the walls are images of white dragons in flight.

A visual inspection from either doorway indicates that the walkway looks safe enough—aside from being icy, narrow, and adjacent to an apparently bottomless pit. The walkway that crosses the east and north sides of the chamber is, in fact, safe, and characters can walk along it without difficulty. The walkway that crosses the west and south walls is weakened and dangerous. When a character reaches the bend in the walkway, have the player roll any die. If an odd number is rolled, a portion of the wall crumbles, and any creature on the walkway must attempt a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed off the walkway into the chute.

The chute drops 60 feet to the top of the ice platform in area 16  in Arauthator's lair. A creature tipped into the chute slides as much as falls, taking only 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage when hitting bottom. The creature must then attempt a Dexterity saving throw or fall off the ice platform; see area 16 for more information. A creature that jumps into the chute on purpose takes half damage from the descent and has advantage on the saving throw to stay on the ice platform.

### 7. Hall of Giants

The bodies of some of the frost giants Arauthator has fought and killed over the centuries are on display in this chamber, frozen into crystal-clear ice walls. Visibility at this level is only 45 feet, so characters won't be able to see much from the doorway. As they move into the chamber, the shape of the first frost giant becomes dimly visible at a distance of 60 feet. At 45 feet, the figure is easily mistakable for a living frost giant standing perfectly still. At 30 feet, the characters recognize that the giant is dead and frozen, seeing its torn armor and the awful claw wounds in its pale blue flesh. The hall displays the bodies of eight frost giants, one fire giant, and one cloud giant.

When the characters arrive in this area, 8 **kobolds** are working in the chamber, polishing and maintaining the ice. If they recognize the characters as intruders, they try to keep away from them in the fog, then slip out of the chamber when they can.

## Ice Caves (areas 8-14)

### 8. Trophy Hall

Trophies of Arauthator's many battles are displayed in this chamber. Visibility is 45 feet, so the characters won't be able to see much from the doorway. Among the creatures frozen here in death are two remorhazes, a trio of behirs, five abominable yetis, and a giant squid of jaw-dropping size. A complete longship with sail raised is also on display here. The ship clearly will not fit through any of the iceberg's entrances; it was painstakingly disassembled outside and reassembled here by the kobolds. Characters who know ships can see mistakes in the rigging and hull planking, but it's passably good work for a display.

#### Treasure

Of more immediate interest is the open chest of gold and jewels sitting on the ship's deck. The chest contains 375 gp, 1,480 ep, and 495 sp, plus jewelry and precious objects worth another 225 gp. A character examining the chest without disturbing it or the contents can estimate its value at between 1,000 and 1,500 gp with a successful DC 10 Intelligence check.

If the chest or any of the treasure it contains—even a single coin—is removed from the ship, Arauthator senses it immediately and dispatches 2 **ice trolls** (see area 12) to investigate.

### 9. Unused Chamber

This chamber is empty, awaiting the day when Arauthator's collection of trophies overflows areas 7 and 8.

### 10. Maccath the Crimson

If **Maccath the Crimson** hasn't been encountered elsewhere in Oyaviggaton, the characters meet her here.

At the top of the ramp from area 9, 1 ice **ice troll** (see area 12) stands guard over this cavern. It positions itself around the corner so it can't be seen until intruders reach the top of the ramp.

>The empty ice floor of this chamber holds a most unexpected sight. A large shelter is seemingly built of scraps, and in the style of the tents used by the desert nomads of Calimshan, some two thousand miles to the south.

Maccath's shelter is made from huge tapestries and carpets draped across a frame of whale ribs, and stands 8 feet tall, 20 feet wide, and 30 feet long. The bottoms of the walls drape down onto the ground, leaving no gaps underneath. The tent has no obvious entrance, but a character can slide between any two overlapping tapestries to emerge inside the shelter.

When the characters step inside, read or paraphrase the following.

>The interior of the shelter is surprisingly warm, thanks to a small stove and simple lamps burning aromatic whale oil. Carpets are heaped on the floor in thick layers, and tapestries from every culture in Faerûn hang suspended from a sturdy frame of whale ribs.
>Books and scrolls are stacked neatly on tables and reading stands made of hide and whalebone. The only furnishings in the shelter not made from these natural materials are the carpets and tapestries, and a portable writing desk that appears to have been taken from a sailing ship.

If this is the characters' first meeting with **Maccath the Crimson**, add:

>Seated at the writing desk is a female tiefling wearing a blazing crimson cloak over tailored furs. The cloak is fastened with a silver-and-ivory brooch bearing a design reminiscent of a stylized, branching tree—the symbol of the Arcane Brotherhood. Two kobold attendants stand nearby, glancing nervously between you and the tiefling. After a few moments, the tiefling looks up with an expression of pale disinterest and asks, "Have you come to save me or kill me? Not that there will be much difference between the two."

When Maccath arrived at Oyaviggaton three years ago, Arauthator would normally have killed her without a second thought. However, the brooch of the Arcane Brotherhood she wore suggested to Arauthator that the tiefling might present a solution to two problems. First, the dragon possessed numerous items stolen from the Arcane Brotherhood, some of which defied his understanding even after decades of study. Second, Arauthator had long sought to help his mate Arveiaturace overcome her grief over the death of the wizard she once served. Replacing that wizard with a member of the Arcane Brotherhood seemed a perfect solution.

Maccath was smart enough to convince the dragon that his offer had won her over, expecting that she would eventually be able to seek a means of escape from the iceberg. However, she has so far been thwarted by Arauthator's potent magic—including spells and rituals stolen from the Arcane Brotherhood—which have kept her sealed and helpless in Oyaviggaton, invisible to scrying and unable to use *sending* to call for help. Before he turns Maccath over to Arveiaturace, Arauthator has had the tiefling deciphering his stolen writings, though the work has gone slowly thanks to the inherent complexity and danger of the material. Maccath is studying one of the stolen scrolls when the characters walk in.

If the characters announced their presence by fighting the **ice troll**, the 2 **kobolds** will be visibly agitated, even though Maccath shows little concern. The kobolds have been directed to stay with the tiefling and follow her orders, which mostly means undertaking errands to the scriptorium (area 11). She also relies on them for cooking, housekeeping, and other mundane chores. The moment the characters make it clear that they are here to rescue Maccath, the kobolds make a dash for area 12. They alert the ice trolls unless they are stopped.

#### Maccath's Bargain

Though she is a prisoner, Maccath has become obsessed with completing Arauthator's challenging magical translations. Like most members of the Arcane Brotherhood, she is dedicated to the point of arrogance, believing that even if she is fated to die as a dragon's plaything, she will have accomplished something magnificent first.

As such, the tiefling sets out terms for her rescue, saying that she won't leave Oyaviggaton without bringing along as much of the Arcane Brotherhood's stolen property as she can. If the characters agree, Maccath shares the following information:

- Arauthator is currently in area 20 of his lair, close to the entrance beneath the scriptorium (area 11).
- Most of the material stolen from the Hosttower is in the scriptorium, but a few items might be in Arauthator's lair (see "Arauthator's Treasure" at the end of this chapter.)
- Maccath knows the general layout of the dragon's cavern but not its specific dangers. Arauthator has never allowed her out of his sight in the lair. In particular, she knows nothing of the scrags in area 15 or the traps in area 18.
- Two entrances lead to Arauthator's lair—one in the adjoining scriptorium and the other in area 6.
- Arauthator moves in and out of the lair using underwater passages.
- The *Draakhorn* was here when Maccath came to Oyaviggaton, but a group of humans wearing distinctive robes came to the iceberg half a year ago. After negotiation with Arauthator, they took the device away. (The characters recognize Cult of the Dragon regalia in Maccath's description of the humans.) In addition to this, Maccath can tell the characters all the information about the *Draakhorn* as it's described in *chapter 17*.
- Trying to escape from the iceberg on a ship would be suicidal while Arauthator is able to attack from the air. The dragon is content to let his minions deal with intruders, but he will be alerted if the characters flee.
- Even if the adventurers have not alerted any of the dragon's servants, Maccath's absence would be reported within a day. When that happens, the dragon will come looking for her and whoever helped her escape.

Maccath knows that surprise is the characters' best weapon for challenging the dragon, and that he will not risk dying over this single lair. Though he hates the idea of abandoning a home with its treasure and trophies, if bested by the adventurers, Arauthator will flee to one of his other lairs.

#### Treasure

If the party seems intent on fighting Arauthator, Maccath offers them a *ring of resistance (cold)* and two *arrows of slaying (dragons)* that she has crafted during her captivity. Though these items and her draconic knowledge give the characters an edge, she warns the party that Arauthator has devoured almost every hero he has faced.

### 11. Scriptorium

Though this chamber is deeper than the adjacent caverns, no mist hangs in the air here.

>Three shelves stand in this otherwise empty cavern, cobbled together out of salvaged wood, whale bone, pieces of giants' armor, and even the frozen limbs of yetis. A number of scrolls, books, parchments, and folios are carefully arranged on the shelves, all bearing the markings of magical writing.

If Maccath is with the characters, she can direct them to the items stolen from the Hosttower of the Arcane. She cautions the characters not to read or even peruse the material for their own safety. The writings are laced with diabolical lore that is anathema to the mortal mind.

Characters unable to read magic can't make any headway in the books. A character who can read magic who examines the writings must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Success indicates that the character recognizes the danger and stops reading. Failure indicates the character absorbs the power of the fiendish lore and suffers a psychic shock. While suffering this shock, the character has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and must attempt a DC 10 Constitution check to cast a spell. On a failed check, the spell cannot be cast, though the spell slot is not expended. The character can make another saving throw to end the effect each time he or she finishes a long rest.

#### Treasure

Arcane spellcasters can find much of value in this scriptorium, along with much that's worthless. Arauthator has collected many spellbooks from slain wizards over the centuries. More importantly for the party's immediate benefit, he also collected dozens of scrolls. Though many of those here have deteriorated from dampness or age, characters who spend a few minutes searching can find ten *spell scrolls*: *gaseous form*, *haste*, *protection from energy*, *water breathing*, *Evard's black tentacles*, *fire shield*, *wall of fire*, *hold monster*, *chain lightning*, and *disintegrate*.

#### Access to Arauthator's Lair

Near the western end of the scriptorium, a 15-foot-wide chute leads down to area 19 of Arauthator's lair. The dragon can clamber up and down this passage without difficulty. Characters proficient in Athletics can climb down the chute using crampons or some other device to grip the wall. Other characters can climb down only with ropes, pitons, and other climbing gear. The chute descends 60 feet to the roof of area 19, after which characters must drop 15 feet to the ice platform.

Before the characters head down into the cavern, Maccath tells them they have no easy way back up to these chambers. Old White Death doesn't want anyone—intruders or guests—to be able to easily leave his lair.

### 12. Ice Trolls

The ice trolls that Arauthator has gathered to his service use this hall as their residence, and no other creatures are permitted here. An **ice troll** has bluish, translucent skin and immunity to cold damage; it otherwise has the statistics of an ordinary troll.

A minimum of 2 **ice trolls** are here when characters first enter, but 3 or more can be placed in this area at your discretion (and depending on whether the adventurers meet conditions that might lead to fighting; see below).

>This cavernous chamber is filled with drifting mist that shrouds a field of ice pillars rising from floor to ceiling. The muffled silence beyond is broken only by the sound of running water.

Ice pillars and pressure ridges form razor-sharp crags that loom out of the roiling fog. Streams of crackling water, magically flowing even at subzero temperatures, course thickly through the hollows beneath wind-driven, icy snow.

From the entrance, only swirling fog can be seen and only the wind can be heard. If Maccath or any ice toad is with the party, they advise the characters in the strongest possible terms to stay out of this chamber. Those who venture here aree silently surrounded and ambushed by the ice trolls. The trolls hungrily pursue the adventurers if they flee, but they heed the ice toads and refrain from attacking if the toads command them to.

The trolls speak Giant and understand a little bit of the Draconic tongue. They are willing to trade or bargain with characters who prove too difficult to kill. Only the verifiable offer of food and treasure can convince the trolls to turn against Arauthator.

### 13. Ice Toad Workplace

Giant ice toads serve Arauthator as overseers at Oyaviggaton. They manage the labor of the kobolds, direct the Ice Hunter villagers to provide the lair with food and other supplies, and have the patience required to deal with the ornery ice trolls.

>A bizarre sight greets you in this rough-walled chamber. About a dozen giant toads with thick, mottled white hides are at work here, scribing strange writing into the ice of the walls, or onto weathered parchment and stone tablets. A few toads transfer parchments and tablets into and out of floor-to-ceiling cubbyholes cut into the ice along the entire southern wall.

A total of 11 **ice toads** (see *appendix D* for statistics) work in this chamber, scribing records and tallies into the ice using sharpened antlers or their own claws. They also maintain rough maps of the Sea of Moving Ice based on reports from the Ice Hunter villagers. At regular intervals, their temporary records are transferred to more permanent form.

See "Random Encounters" (above) for guidelines on how the giant ice toads respond to intruders. The characters' best chance to avoid a fight in this area—and to keep the toads from alerting the ice trolls—is to win the ice toads to their cause by treating with their leader, **Marfulb**.

The average ice toad is smart, but their leader **Marfulb** is exceptional (Intelligence 13). Her knack for organization and governance had no outlet until her path crossed Arauthator's on the Sea of Moving Ice, and she has served as the seneschal of Oyaviggaton for the four decades since. Not even Arauthator understands the workings of Oyaviggaton as well as **Marfulb**, who knows the contents and value of every pack, chest, and heap of coins in the iceberg down to the last copper piece.

#### Marfulb's Lore

In addition to data about Arauthator—his treasures, mating habits, and epic battles with frost giants and other monsters—the information amassed by the ice toads includes exhaustive details on the ever-changing Sea of Moving Ice, the weather north of the Spine of the World, and the culture of the elusive Ice Hunters. **Marfulb** feels great satisfaction in her life's work, but she knows too little about society south of the Spine of the World to sense its full importance.

Characters equipped with a *bag of holding* could take all the parchments and stone slabs with them when they leave Oyaviggaton. The Arcane Brotherhood would regard the lore as one of the most amazing works of natural philosophy in existence (once it is painstakingly translated from the ice toads' unique language), and they would clamor to meet and praise **Marfulb**. Without a *bag of holding*, the collection is too large to move.

### 14. Ice Toad Lair

This freezing, miserable chamber makes a perfect home for the ice toads, but is presently empty. None of the toads' belongings here has value as loot, but they make a strange and curious collection. Such objects include walrus-tooth wart scrapers, spears fashioned from narwhal horn, oddly shaped furniture sculpted into the icy floor instead of rising above it, writing implements carved from baleen and shaped for a webbed hand, and art objects that combine carved whalebone, driftwood, and mundane items such as silverware and glass stoppers salvaged from shipwrecks.
