The dragon's lair is a single, cavernous chamber with many nooks, crannies, and icy outcroppings.

## General Features

Like the caverns above it, Arauthator's lair is composed entirely of ice.

***Ceiling.*** The rough ceiling of the open cavern rises 40 feet above the varying height of the uneven floor.

***Floors.*** The floor of the cavern is worn smooth and is highly slippery. Arauthator and the scrags move across the slick ice with ease thanks to their claws, but characters without crampons or the ability to walk on ice treat all areas of the lair cavern as difficult terrain. See the "General Features" of the ice caves for information on crampons. Snowshoes are of no help in the lair.

The terrain levels represented on the map of the cavern show increments of 8 feet. The elevation of the floor results from the ice splitting and splintering, so the ledges are abrupt and have a distinctly step-like appearance. Characters can drop down a level without difficulty. Scrambling up a level requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check; the climber has advantage on the check if equipped with crampons or climbing gear.

***Light.*** The lair cavern is normally dark. All description assumes that the characters have a light source or darkvision.

***Temperature.*** The lair cavern is colder than the tunnels and chambers above it. The cavern is a bone-chilling 0 degrees Fahrenheit. Area 20 is even colder.

***Visibility.*** Banks of vapor roll through the cavern, limiting visibility to 60 feet for characters with light.

## 15. Scrags' Lair

This corner of the cavern is home to 2 **scrags** that Arauthator allows to live in his lair, provided they guard it in his absence. These aquatic trolls can breathe underwater and have a swimming speed of 30 feet.

If the characters approach, the scrags duck into hiding places, then attempt to attack from ambush and claim an unexpected meal.

## 16. Ice Pillars

Pillars of ice jut from the floor in this area. Climbing an ice pillar more than 8 feet tall requires a climber's kit and a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

A creature dropping down the chute from area 6 lands on the top level of the large ice platform in the southeast part of the cavern, 16 feet above the cavern floor. The creature must then succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to stay on the platform. (A creature that intentionally jumps down the chute takes half damage from the descent and has advantage on this saving throw.) If the saving throw fails, the creature slides off the top level of the icy platform and hits the second level, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage and falling prone.

Any creature falling to the cavern floor attracts the attention of the scrags in area 15.

## 17. The Icewolf's Spine

This jagged ridge of ice divides the cavern into sections. Climbing up to at least the 8-foot level and moving along the ridge is the only safe way to get from area 15 or 16 into area 19 or 20 without encountering the traps in areas 18a and 18b.

Unlike other ledges in the cavern, the horizontal surfaces of the Icewolf's Spine aren't level. The denizens of the lair can traverse the ledges without difficulty, but any other creature that moves more than 15 feet during a round must make a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Failure indicates that the creature loses its footing and falls to the next level below, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage and landing prone. Wearing crampons grants advantage on this check.

## 18a. The Gullet

This narrow passage is rigged with a magic trap. When the first character passes through the narrowest point of the passage, the entire area of the passage fills with a *stinking cloud* for 1 minute.

Arauthator immediately becomes aware of intruders if the *stinking cloud* is triggered. The dragon does not set off the trap if it moves through the area.

## 18b. The Throat

This narrow passage is rigged with a magic trap. When the first character moves through the narrowest point of the passage, a *slow* spell is triggered, targeting every creature in the area. Creatures affected by the spell suffer its effects for 1 minute.

Arauthator immediately becomes aware of intruders if the *slow* spell is triggered. The dragon does not set off the trap if it moves through the area.

## 19. The Perch

Arauthator sometimes sleeps on this vast ice shelf, but more often he spends his time lounging in area 20. Much of the treasure the dragon keeps at Oyaviggaton is stashed here and on the ledges above. See "Arauthator's Treasure," below.

## 20. Arauthator's Abyss

The western end of the lair cavern is where Arauthator (an **adult white dragon**) spends most of his time at Oyaviggaton. Gold, jewels, and other treasure lies scattered on the floor and frozen into the walls of this vast chamber.

It is noticeably colder here than anywhere else in the iceberg, reachingâ€“10 degrees Fahrenheit. Any character in an area where the temperature is below 0 degrees Fahrenheit must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour. Characters without cold weather gear automatically fail this save. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.

When the characters face off against Arauthator, the dragon roars so loudly that the whole iceberg reverberates with his rage. This calls the ice trolls from area 12, which arrive 5 rounds later.

Pools of slush spread across the floor of the cavern, prevented from freezing by the seawater's high salt content. One such pool, in the westernmost angle of the cavern, conceals a flooded passage connecting to the Sea of Moving Ice. This is Arauthator's customary entrance and exit. When the dragon is reduced to 100 hit points or fewer and facing three or more foes, he dives for this exit and escapes into the frozen sea. If the dragon flees, the ice trolls retreat as well.
