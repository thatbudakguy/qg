# Winter 1509

It happens sometime after the events of Uktar 9 at Valhingen graveyard, but it's impossible to say how long now. Regardless, one day as the wind is howling at the cracks in Denlor's tower you notice it ‚Äì¬†the painting upstairs on the door to Denlor's chambers is gone. Vanished, as though it had never been there at all, leaving simple wood in its place. You're not that stupid, though ‚Äì¬†you call up Declan to make sure the magical aura is gone. Which it isn't. So you leave it alone for awhile.

Two days later, the hulking Efreeti on the door shows up again. Except this time he's on the door to the pantry, which you notice as you stumble outside the servant's quarters into the frigid cold of the unheated building. You shout for the rest of the gang, who tumble out of their hammocks in surprise, only to find that the painting is gone again. Declan blearily casts *detect magic*, finding no traces on the door to the pantry, hanging open now to show the small arsenal you and Hagar stashed there several weeks ago. Everyone shuffles back to bed grumpily.

Resolving to figure out what the hell exactly is going on in this decrept old ruin, you apply yourself to the task of deciphering Denlor's library. The task is not straightforward: most of the tomes that remain on the shelves in the lecture hall are a hodgepodge of topics, from the arcane to the mundane. You spend an hour going through every book you can find, some of them now crumbling in the damp cold.

Among the old histories and dusty tomes, the first volume that catches your eye is called the *War Mage's Companion.* This sturdy and well-worn book turns out to have several identical siblings tucked in among the other shelves, all of them in various states of heavy use, some even with added scribblings in the margin. Without a doubt, this must have been Denlor's textbook of choice. You apply yourself to it with interest, hoping to pick up some useful tactics from a master evoker.

Finally, you manage to uncover a curious imposter: a book that is clothed in a jacket that is not its own! Peeking out from behind the dull gray leather on a high shelf is a small, gilded red volume. Pulling the false cover off reveals its name ‚Äì¬†*The Exodus of Raumark.* Though it appears to be just another history of some kind, you find yourself leafing through the pages anyway, wondering why Denlor would have bothered to conceal such a thing.

The book tells the story of a clan of wizards fleeing the powerful magical creatures that had overrun their homeland more than a thousand years ago. Escaping to the south of Faerun led by the archwizard Raumark, they found a warm and humid land surrounded on three sides by massive mountain ranges. Settling the area and making peace with the natives, they founded an isolationist, magocratic state dedicated to peaceful pursuit of the Art. Their new nation of Halruaa eventually became renowned for its primary exports: high-quality electrum, and a rich, velvety wine fabled throughout the realms called Haerlu.

As the days and nights grow colder, you begin making more excursions to the overgrown and sometimes snow-covered front yard for spellsparring. At first, Declan is too cautious an opponent to make much use of the methods in the *War Mage's Companion*, but as both of your confidence starts to grow, the duels get start to get flashier. By midwinter, you've learned how to concentrate on your connection to Bahamut, refusing to break concentration even when lashed with powerful spells. Amazingly, the winter passes with only one major incident involving Declan's attempt to recreate Sammaster's *augmentation* spell on *Maximilian's earthen grasp*.

All this time, the moving painting and what lies beyond is never far from your mind. On the coldest night of winter, you creep up to the second floor alone, determined to get to the bottom of things. Taking a few minutes to gather your thoughts, you concentrate quietly on a *dispel magic* spell, hoping Bahamut will lend you the strength to open this door.

Unleashing the full force of the spell, you watch as arcane energy pours over the door. Nothing happens. Then, you nearly jump through the roof, as the Efreet on the door turns to look directly at you. A voice booms out, seemingly coming from everywhere in the room at once:

> *Enough!* You vermin have nested in the tower of Denlor long enough! If you do not leave now I will burn you all to a crisp!
>

‚ùì What do you do?

[Ali continues commanding Peregrine to leave, saying he is "not even a sha'ir" but can be convinced if Peregrine makes any claims at being a powerful wizard, etc. Eventually the gang all hear the commotion and come up too. Eventually, Ali just decides to "burn you all", but all he can do is raise the temperature slowly until it's pleasantly warm. When everyone realizes this, Ali flies into a rage and tries to bait them into opening the door. If they leave, he yells at them to come back.]

> always he is saying "oh, Ali, could you heat my chambers little bit, it's so cold here in the norz" and "Ali, please, could you turn up ze heat in ze cellar, i'm so old and my feet so cold". Why never say to me "Ali, how was your day? What it is like being bound into ze walls of building?"
> 

If anyone asks Ali to heat Denlor's tower for them, he refuses to do so unless they prove they are ready to "stop living like dogs". He gives them a riddle. 

> At the court of ze sultan was girel...how you call zis...prinzess. Zis girel always she was jealous of her sister. One day she ask sha'ir to command a jinn to help her. Jinn come to her but he says to her "I am only half magic. I will give to you wish, but your sister she will have two times what I give to you always. I will give you to you three wish." First, she wish to be richest girel in ze world. But her zizter soon become richest girl in ze world because she get two times money. Then she wish to most beautiful girel in ze world. But her zizter is become more beautiful. At the end, what did zis girel wish?
> 

[she wish to be beaten half to death].

If anyone attempts to persuade Ali to open the door to Denlor's personal quarters, he tells them they're not even close to worthy of that yet.
