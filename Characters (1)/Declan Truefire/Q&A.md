# Q&A

- Where do you see yourself in five years?

Given the recent turmoil in Declan’s life, it’s hard to say where he sees himself in five years because he doesn’t even know where he sees himself in five days. He would like to have some semblance of a base of operations, whether that be a small apartment, a homestead/farm, or a keep is to be seen and he doesn’t have a particular preference. Growing up within a tight familial unit and being very suddenly detached is very disorienting for him, so he would like to surround himself with people he feels he can really trust.

- What’s something you hope the rest of the gang never finds out about you?

Declan likes to think of himself as very suave and socially ept. However, he had a very lonely childhood and adolescence, never really fitting in. He would find it so incredibly embarrassing if the gang were to ever meet the Diaspor clan. He feels incredibly rejected by his cult family not only for being racially different but also because of the lie that was/is foundational to his sense of self. It’s embarrassing to be duped in that way and he has a strong desire to come off as calm, cool, and unaffected by these “backwards” people that raised him.

- What excites you the most about adventuring?

The possibility. As terrifying as it is to be unleashed into a world you only know from books, Declan now has the chance to write his own story. He was fed a very specific worldview ever since he can remember and it’s wonderful to be able to (what he feels like is) start identity formation from scratch.

- What’s your happiest childhood memory?

The wood elves (before they left the forest) would come and meet with the Voadkyn to exchange goods, information, etc. This was an incredibly happy time in Declan’s childhood as it was his only time interacting with beings that even sort of looked like him. They would bring him books as well (as oftentimes, books were Declan’s only friends).

- Who have been the most important people in your life?

The cult was very communally oriented, and there are no analog “father” and “mother” voadkyn in Declan’s life. However, a few people do stand out:

- **Ginkaos:** the overseer of much of the agricultural output of the cult. He was always curious to Declan because he was far and away the least woo woo of the cult. Declan never felt like Ginkaos treated him differently or specially (while all the others did) and he kinda got the vibe that Ginkaos really didn’t think he was all that special at all. Very disappointing. I mean, have you seen Declan’s hair???
- **Yethor**: his tutor. VERY much bought into the idea that Declan was a special little boy. She was particularly zealous in the cult and firmly believes that not only are the Voadkyn the superior giant race, but also this specific group of Voadkyn was chosen specifically by Chauntea to be the only group of giants to survive some apocalyptic event in the future.
- **Saelithil**: a young elf girl that Declan would consider his only friend growing up. He saw her sporadically (and then not at all after the elves left), but she was the only peer of his that treated him with kindness.
- I would say the cult probably has like 40 or so members?
