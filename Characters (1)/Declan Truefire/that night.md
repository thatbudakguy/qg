# "that night"

Declan had stayed up far too late to finish his book. He couldn’t help it -- djinn were far too interesting and he longed to have the chance to see them one day. He was restless and knew he wouldn’t be able to sleep that night. Seeking to stretch his legs and fire up some neurons, he began the short walk to the library. It was a cool night and he couldn’t stop thinking about the terrifying possibility that he would get sucked into a djinn whirlwind one day, but the stars were out and that brought him slight comfort. He walked into the small building the voadkyn called the library (though in Declan’s opinion “library” was a strong word.) Placing the book on djinn back and grabbing a tome entitled “History of Calimshan,” he began to leaf through it as he turned to go back to his quarters. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the faint flicker of candlelight and whispering voices coming from the adjoining hallway. It was very peculiar for the Voadkyn to wander around at night because they were very superstitious about the creepy crawlies darkness brings. Declan crept towards the flickering light, carefully avoiding the planks he knew made horrid creaking sounds. He pressed himself close to the wall and listened to the exchange taking place in the dining hall.

“I’m worried about Ginkaos. He is getting increasingly aggressive towards Declan.”

“Do you think he knows?”

“I can’t imagine how he could. Only you, I, and Logi know the truth. It’s incredibly important that we maintain this… embellishment. You’ll have to take care of him.”

“...Do you ever think we did the wrong thing?”

“Diaspor was *dying* before we found him in the forest. Chauntea had turned her back on us. What we did to displease her I do not know. What I do know is 14 Voadkyn left us that harvest. They all turned their backs on Chauntea. They turned their backs on *us*. We needed to tell everyone he was a gift from god or they would have all left. Everything we worked for would have vanished thanks to one bad harvest. Everything we have done to uplift Chauntea would have been lost. And really, what harm did it do? Give the boy a slight self-esteem boost? Our harvest the next year was the most abundant in all my lifetime.”

“Where did you find him? I don’t believe I’ve ever heard the full story.”

“Not far from here. Swaddled in some sort of canvas. He had clearly been there for a day or two. How he wasn’t eaten or hadn’t died from hunger I do not know. As soon as I saw the miserable little bundle, I knew his potential. I knew nothing of him or his circumstance but I knew what he could do for us. And clearly Chauntea was pleased! Why else would we have begun to prosper once again? Regardless of the circumstances, I think you’ll agree that Ginkaos be dealt with somehow. The whole clan now believes he to be our savior. I don’t think the boy knows his power. I won’t stand for a curmudgeonly old man casting doubt on him.”

“I’ll take care of him. Nothing too harsh or obvious of course. Thank you for entrusting him with me.”

“Of course. You’re one of the few I trust to be unflinchingly committed to our cause. The others are followers, but we… we are leaders. We are prophets.”

Declan heard Cekvog and Drodcaros shifting in their seats. Numbly, Declan stole around the corner and into the library once more. He sank to the floor and cradled his head in his hands.
