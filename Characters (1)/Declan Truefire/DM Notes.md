# DM Notes

ideas:

- create a [bladesinger subclass](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wizard:bladesinger); allow declan to become a pupil?
- declan finds the Artblade and passes the Bladerite
- the red dragon Edallisufanxar has the Artblade
- two paths for declan: embracing elvenkind, or embracing his human side
- declan has a half-brother? who is pure elf; member of Eldreth Valuuthra, elf supremacists who want to see humanity wiped from faerun. His desire is to be the arms-major and wield the Warblade
- The human mage Demron created the *baneblades* for the Elven court at Myth Drannor in the  400s DR; perhaps he is the key to understanding where the Artblade lies (with Edallisufanxar). Alternatively, maybe a blade surfaces claiming to be the Artblade, but Demron (or knowledge gained from him) reveals it is really only one of the *baneblades*. These were made during the Opening, a time when all races were permitted to live in Myth Drannor.
