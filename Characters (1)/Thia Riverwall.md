# Thia Riverwall

# Appearance

Young elven girl with blonde hair in a ponytail, wearing a priest’s cassock depicting a flowering tree. Reminds you of Cassyt.

# Roleplaying

- Strives for compromise and harmony during confrontations.
- Tilts her head to look up when thinking before speaking.

# Background

High Huntress Riverwall spent her youth exploring the Vine Vale of Evereska, becoming more intimately acquainted with its hills and dales than any child in the past few centuries. Her natural aptitude for divine magic came to light when her parents discovered that she claimed to speak directly with Rillifane Rallathil — an assertion that was quickly verified when she correctly predicted her mother would soon bear her a brother.

Thia’s tendency to spout prophecies and visions connected directly to Rillifane made her a darling of the clergy, albeit an unconventional one. Over the objections of many of the church’s senior members, she was made High Huntress before she was 50 years old, an event unprecedented in Evereska’s history. She takes a loose hand to the city’s politics, preferring to smooth over conflicts and redirect tempers with her cool manner and uncanny ability to predict the future.

# Key Info

- On Ches 9, the day before Skyreach crashed, followers of Rillifane began fasting for the vernal equinox. They will break their fast on Ches 19 after a tenday and celebrate “The Budding” with a hunt.
- Rillifane is the god of the forest and also of the hunt. His duality has captivated Elves since the First Flowering. Rillifane’s symbol is the great tree whose roots are the earth and whose branches are the sky.
