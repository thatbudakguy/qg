# Lord Sage of Phlan

An extremely old half-elf who walks with the aid of a staff but has a youthful vigor and sense of humor. Pretends his age affects him more than it really does.

As the Lord Sage, he oversees the venerable Mantor's Library, including its massive and mysterious archives. Skeptical of the rule of the Black Fist, he nevertheless maintains a cordial relationship with the Lord Regent Ector Brahms, to whom he traditionally serves as an advisor. He is good friends with [Aya Glenmiir](Aya%20Glenmiir.md), whom he considers a confidante.
