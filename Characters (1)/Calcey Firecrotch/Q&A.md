where do you see yourself in five years?

---

Rich enough to stop galavanting around with no purpose. Settling down, maybe in a high-up position of a local thieves guild, teaching young ones the craft. Spreading a general "robin-hood-esque" morality thru the guild.

whats something you hope the rest of the gang never find out about you?

I killed an old man once in a home invasion theft gone wrong. he was a rich guy that I thought would make an easy target to rob at night, but he woke up while I was there and lept at me with a dagger. He was a veteran of war so, fiesty and ready to kill and defend himself even in his old age. I barely survived and was forced to put him in a chokehold until he suffocated to death. Thats the only time I've killed someone and regretted it...

what excites you the most about adventuring?

fuckin money dude, cmon

whats your happiest childhood memory?

---

When I first learned to pick a lock from my next door neighbor Cere (pronounced "siri") She was a few years older and had already done a few heists. I really looked up to her and when I masted the new skill she taught me, I felt like I could really take anything I wanted. Later that night I stole 2 silver pieces from the lockbox by Cere's mom's bed. I loved Cere, but her mom was a cunt.

who have been the most important people in your life?

Mom and Cere - I'd either be a filthy peat farmer, or dead if it wasnt for them.
