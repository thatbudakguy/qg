# Ali

[DM Notes](DM%20Notes.md)

This cranky genie was imprisoned by the wizard Denlor, and has served as a form of central heating in the wizard's tower for an unknown period of time. When [Peregrine Buntly](../Peregrine%20Buntly/%21index.md) investigated the painting of an Efreet on the door to Denlor's chambers, Ali finally revealed himself, accusing the gang of squatting in the great wizard's tower.

Ali's spirit has been bound into Denlor's tower, but he can move between windows and doors within the tower freely. He generally manifests as a stylized painting of himself on the door to Denlor's personal quarters, which he was explicitly commanded to guard against any not worthy of entering. In life, Ali looked like other Efreet: a large, well-muscled humanoid with dark red skin of about 12 feet tall, with small horns sprouting from his bald head.
