This large dragonhide-bound tome was recovered by the Gang from the belongings of Jeralla, the leader of the Claws of Tiamat, who was killed in the battle at King's Pyre. It appears to have some level of sentience, being able to float in the air and manipulate its pages along with a quill. The contents of the book are mostly flowery descriptions of the glory of Jeralla, evidently recorded during her time as the self-identified Chosen of Tiamat.

When the book was examined by the [Lord Sage of Phlan](../Lord%20Sage%20of%20Phlan.md) and [Aya Glenmiir](../Aya%20Glenmiir.md), they concluded that it contained the spirit of a once-living humanoid â€“ perhaps a woman. The magic needed to imprison a spirit in such a way, however, is a closely guarded arcane secret considered taboo for any wizard with a conscience. Binding the spirit into the book would have required the talents of someone both highly skilled and morally corrupt.

In [Sky Prince](../../Adventure%20Log/%F0%9F%90%A6%20Sky%20Prince.md), Declan added simple phrases like "yes" and "maybe" to the book so that it could communicate by pointing, along with letters of the alphabet. Identifying itself as Eryn, the book seemed to suggest that it had been unwillingly bound to serve Jeralla and tell her story, perhaps as a gift to Jeralla by an entity it named "R". Eryn seemed willing to continue accompanying the Quarantine Gang on their adventures.
