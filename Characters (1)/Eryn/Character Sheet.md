# Character Sheet

The book appears to float in the air (up to 20 feet off the ground) as though continually under the effects of a *levitate* spell. It can push against other objects or carry up to the same weight as *mage hand (*10 lbs). It has blindsight out to a radius of 30ft, and is blind beyond this radius.

The book can engage in a limited form of communication by using its pages to "point" to words that have already been written there. Because it was cursed to tell Jeralla's story, it is incapable of writing new words unless they are about Jeralla (who is dead). If the curse is lifted (e.g. by a *remove curse* spell), the book is capable of writing using an ordinary quill as it pleases onto the pages.

To free the spirit of Eryn from the book, one would need to:

- Know Eryn's name and background
-
