# Winter 1509

The first winter you've spent in civilization begins with strange dreams. Unfortunately, the vision you witnessed aboard the *Kite* seems to have returned, and with it the anxiety about your path. The cold of Denlor's Tower does not bother you as much as it does the other residents, but during the long nights of midwinter it sometimes becomes hard to distinguish between waking and sleeping. Your dreams are dominated by the image of the tree spread out among the stars, its roots encircling the body of the great bear.

During the day, you travel often to Scholar's Square to visit Aya Glenmiir, consulting the wizard for advice on your developing connection to totem magic and its associated rituals. Though the old half-elf is not well-versed in ritual magic, she is a wonderfully patient teacher who has helped generations of noble families of the Moonsea unlock their potential as arcanists, and she is more than willing to help you explore the possibilities of your spiritual connection to the bear.

Together, the two of you develop a ritual to call forth a spirit companion, a manifestation of the primal energy that underlies all the world's wild places. In theory, the spell should make you able to call forth small animals, speaking to them in the tongue of the forest and the plains. Yet each time you sit and focus your energy on the totem, it is as though a door inside you opens, and some *presence* is with you, invisibly. It's impossible to describe this sensation, though you try to convey to Aya how something is *there* with you, wordless and mute but very much present.

Occasionally, you fail to complete the ritual because portions of the vision you had aboard the *Kite* resurface, almost violently, like bits of a wrecked ship floating about in a storm. Sometimes it's the one-eyed orc, riding hard across the plains clutching two tiny children to his chest. Other times, you see the strange ice-beings plodding through the smoking carnage of the city in the snow. Most often, it's the single baleful eye of the great bear, immobilized at the foot of the tree that reaches the sky. You are initially conflicted about revealing these images to the curious Aya, but eventually conclude the old wizard is only concerned for your health and means no harm.

After a particularly bad episode that causes you to lose the sequence of the ritual, Aya takes a break to make tea for the both of you, staring out at the cold rain falling on Podol Plaza. "You know," she says slowly, "the forces at work here are a little outside my area of expertise. But I think I know a place where you could dig deeper, if you wanted to. Have you considered visiting home?"

The trek is a long one, and undertaking it at this season puts you at grave risk. To attempt it on foot would be suicide, so the Lord Sage lends you a horse - no charger to be sure, but a beast that will see you through if you are careful. The tribe were constantly in the saddle, even in the winter, and finding them will not be easy. With some information from you, Aya performs a divination spell, sitting in front of a steaming cup of tea. When she opens her eyes, she tells you she saw women and children with long hair, bathing together in a natural hot spring in the mountains, snow falling around them. You know this place.

On the day you set out the skies are clear and blue, a bitter cold whipping off the Bay of Phlan. You say goodbye to your friends and leave the city that has been your home for the past few months, the largest community of humanoids you've ever lived in. The mountains are calling.

The trek is longer than you remember, and more than once you consider turning back. As the road by the half-frozen river winds up towards the Dragonspine mountains, the air becomes thinner, but your thick furs keep your core warm. Somehow, you're less worried about the weather than what will happen when you arrive. When you left home years ago for your military service, it was not under the most comfortable of circumstances. More than that, though, you struggle with what your purpose in this trip is. Will headman Ullo even know what's wrong with you? Can the tribe help?

Crossing the Dragonspines, you arrive at the great northern expanse called The Ride, the closest thing you know to a homeland. Snow is thick on the ground, but your mount is steady and true. The days pass silently, and you begin to feel the solitude acutely, something you never paid much attention to before. As you draw within a few days' ride of the hot springs, the snow falls harder with each passing hour. With visibility so low, navigating via landmarks as you are used to on the open plain is almost impossible.

You dismount, clearing a small space on the rocky ground in which to work. Taking off the bear claw totem and laying it in front of you, you try to focus your energy the way you did in Aya Glenmiir's shop, closing your eyes and resting cross-legged. The horse eyes you disapprovingly. The cold air sharpens your mind, stripping away all thoughts and leaving the sound of your heartbeat. You concentrate. Some time passes.

Your eyes open to the sound of wingbeats. Muffled but distinct, somewhere near you is a great bird, flying through the snow. Shakily you rise from your seated position, wondering why a bird would be here, hundreds of miles from any tree. From out of the white, a huge snowy owl glides into view, alighting on the bridle of the horse, its claws resting on the leather. Oddly, the horse makes no reaction, seemingly unbothered by the great predator atop its back. The owl rotates its head to fix you in its gaze. Its eyes are jet black and completely without pupils.

Transfixed, you walk slowly towards the bird, not dropping eye contact. It does not react, does not even seem to breathe. As you draw near enough to touch, you reach out a tentative hand, feeling the feathers along one wing. The bird only rotates its head to watch your hand. After a moment of connection, the wings unfold, and the owl beats them once, twice, and takes to the air. Understanding without speaking, you mount the horse and spur it onward, following the owl's path. Some time later, you arrive at the hot springs.

Your return is a blur of happy faces and warm embraces. Your fear at being considered a pariah melts away as you reconnect with families and children you have not seen in years. The wives mock your horse from the city, scrawny and underfed. You laugh. You field the questions about military service gallantly, explaining that you left of your own free will when the company was between campaigns, not giving any more detail than is required. Headman Ullo waits patiently, knowing that you have come home for a reason.

At night in Ullo's tent, you explain the visions. He nods, expressionless but seemingly deep in thought. Then he explains something that surprises you. You know that the totem, the point of connection between all of the Eraka and the land, is meant to symbolize a part of a primal spirit. As they came of age, your peers often crafted totems for the eagle, the wolf, and the hunter. But Ullo saw a different destiny for you. Yours was the bear totem, which had not been taken by any men or women of the tribe for more than a generation.

The connection to the primal spirits, Ullo explains, predates even the arrival of the Eraka to the Ride. The oldest stories tell of a first age, where the people lived in a great forest that was warm and tangled, one filled with the energy that created the world, where trees grew to touch the sky. The primal spirits dwelt there, but a great cataclysm drove them from the forest, forcing the Eraka to flee and become nomads, forever wandering the realms. Since that time the spirits have spoken to their people only sporadically through the totems.

This is all the wisdom that the headman has to give. You find, not surprisingly, that you have more questions than answers. Who or what is responsible for the visions? What are the primal spirits? Is the bear in your vision some manifestation of Magnar, the First Bear? And, most of all, why do the visions fill you with such a powerful sense of dread, a sensation beyond words that you are being called upon to right a great wrong? What can you do to make them stop? These are the questions that flit around you like moths to a campfire as you make the slow return journey over the mountains.

One evening as you are examining some of the strange artifacts in Aya Glenmiir's collection, the quiet of the shop is interrupted by a terrific banging on the exterior windows, as though someone is flailing against them repeatedly. Aya rises quickly to move the heavy curtains from the windows, letting in the weak light of the winter sunset to reveal a tiny winged form battering against the glass, batlike arms flapping about attached to a bright green, scaly body. Rushing outside, you catch just a glimpse of what looks to all the world like a snake with wings, its emerald-colored body glinting in the fading light as it flits up and away out of Scholar's Square.

Laying on the ground at the base of the exterior windows, resting on top of some bushes, is a small scroll tube hardly the size of your hand. Taking the tube back inside, you describe the strange messenger to Aya, who says she has heard tales of winged snakes from the jungles of Chult and other far-flung regions but never quite believed them. Uncorking the tube, you retrieve a letter written in a gorgeous flowing script on fine paper.
