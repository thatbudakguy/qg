# Progression

# Plot

## Act I

- Has disturbing dreams/contact with Magnar, sees visions of events in his past
- King Witchthorn tells him that Magnar is "still looking for you"

## Act II

- Works more on ritual totem magic with Aya's help?
- Maybe goes back to visit headman Ullo to ask what's going on?
- Magnar gives him a first boon (if he accepts this, it replaces his lv6 class feature)
- He has more dreams/visions that show himself, implying Magnar knows of his past

## Act III

- Magnar begins to be clear to him that he must seek the Gatekeeper's Crystal
- Magnar shows him where the remaining shards are (TTX has one and Declan's brother has another, or is getting close to one) but doesn't know about the final shard

## Act IV

- Goes to candlekeep in [Candlekeep](../../Adventures/Candlekeep.md) to learn that the remaining shard is in Myth Ondath

## Act V

- Travels to the ruins of Myth Ondath in [Hunting the Shard](../../Adventures/Hunting%20the%20Shard.md); learns his past fully
- Has to decide whether to use the crystal to free Magnar or not

## Act VI

# Flaws

- Rage
- 

# Bonds

- Magnar
    - why does magnar choose him?
    - magnar feeds him information about his parents/ilza in addition to warlock powers in order to convince him to release magnar
    - magnar has slept a long time and it's unclear what he will do if released/aided. hagar receives vague messaging indicating that magnar wants to "cleanse" the humans and other humanoids who now inhabit his forest, the yuirwood.
    - magnar might grant hagar access to increasingly powerful rituals through his totem, but said rituals might require strange components or other things in order to work, or involve sacrifices or other freaky requirements.
    - what would help magnar? the gatekeeper's crystal will release him
- Family
    - finding out about ilza (her name would also become a half-orc name)
    - finding out about his parents and where they're from
- Tribe
    - returning to the tribe to prove himself
    - connection with headman ullo
