# Gatekeeperâ€™s Crystal

Created: January 9, 2022 3:35 PM
Rarity: Legendary

## What it does
Each shard individually can:
	- Manipulate _portals_ on the Material Plane, especially those created by the Elves, e.g. to alter their destination
	- Manipulate  _mythals_, by editing the commands they apply to reality itself, e.g. to add or remove features (but imperfectly)

When joined together, the crystal can:
	- Completely annihilate a _mythal_, causing severe destruction over its entire effective radius and leaving a huge tear in the Weave
	- Create a permanent _portal_ to any plane of existence with perfect accuracy

Using the crystal is an invocation of Elven High Magic, which requires that life force be expended commensurate with the intended effect.

When all three parts of the Crystal are used together, its "failsafe" activates, scattering the three shards across the planes so that it must be reassembled to be used again in this way.

An unforeseen characteristic of the failsafe is that the shards are "drawn" to locations where the Weave has been warped by previous usage of the Crystal.

## Shard locations

- Recovered from the ruins of Hellgate Keep, now owned by [Thurndan Tallwand](../../Characters/Thurndan%20Tallwand/%21index.md), who refuses to allow it to be taken from Mulmaster and so can't precisely find the locations of the other shards.
- Buried somewhere in the Tortured Lands, where it was used to raze Myth Ondath & later used by the Orc Shaman Uzgat in a ritual that implanted Magnar's memories in [Hagar](../../pcs/hagar-bloodrop.md). Later taken below the surface into the Underdark and kept in Lorosfyr, the Maddening Dark, by the Pale Sybil
- On the demiplane of Sildeyuir, overlapping the forest of Aglarond, where it was once used to imprison the Primal Spirit Magnar (and where Magnar still rests).
