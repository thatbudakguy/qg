## Shard locations

- Recovered from the ruins of Hellgate Keep, now owned by [Thurndan Tallwand](../../Characters/Thurndan%20Tallwand/%21index.md), who refuses to allow it to be taken from Mulmaster and so can't precisely find the locations of the other shards.
- Buried somewhere in the Tortured Lands, where it was used to raze Myth Ondath & later used by the Orc Shaman Uzgat in a ritual that implanted Magnar's memories in [Hagar](../../pcs/hagar-bloodrop.md). Later taken below the surface into the Underdark and kept in Lorosfyr, the Maddening Dark, by the Pale Sybil
- Somewhere on another plane — Avernus? the Blood Rift? Astral Plane? Sildeyuir? Location can be discovered by going to [candlekeep](../../adventures/candlekeep.md).
