# The Moonsea League
## Goals
- amass wealth by trading with Thay, currently a pariah state
- exert political control over all cities of the moonsea by force
## Philosophy
_only fools concern themselves with limits to power_
### The Charter
1. No restrictions or tariffs on trade shall be imposed between any member states of the League.
2. Citizens of League member states shall be granted freedom of movement within the whole territory of the League.
3. Criminals fleeing penalty of death shall be swiftly extradited to the appropriate League member state to face justice.
## Strategy
- first, offer the carrot:
	- trade in rare magical items, spices, and other goods from Thay
	- ability to export goods to Thay, which will pay high price for some things
	- fair prices paid for any unwanted criminal elements, no questions asked
- coerce moonsea cities via naval blockade to sign the charter; no passage through to the Dragonreach
- if blockade fails, use military force and other strongarm tactics, up to and including the Weapon
