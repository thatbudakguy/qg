# Shopping/prep

- scroll of *feather fall* from Aya Glenmiir
    - Sitting a short distance outside Aya's shop and keeping an eye on the door is a bored-looking man in a purple cloak and armband and full plate mail, with a halberd leaning against a nearby wall. His armor bears the device of a silver sword piercing a silver anchor. He is Dyrn, the ward of Devon Nanther, currently studying in Aya's shop. They are staying at the Cracked Crown.
    - Aya is working with a new student named Devon Nanther when the Gang arrive. Devon is a human boy of about fourteen, with long messy blonde hair. He is the grandson of Halmuth "Hal" Nanther, patriarch of one of the three great noble houses of Melvaunt. Aya seems tremendously proud that he has been entrusted to her care. Of Dyrn, she is distateful: he is clumsy and has no sense of humor. She won't let him in the shop for fear he will break something.
    - Aya informs the gang that the Lord Sage thinks he is close to a breakthrough on the shield that they brought to him. She pushed him to consult the resources available in Mantor's Library and together they were able to make a number of determinations - chief among them that the shield actually may be what it claims to be. If this is the truth, they will need to find out whether it represents a danger to simply keep, or whether it can be used.
    - "Whether you wanted to or not, you've already made yourselves central players in this drama. The Moonsea is the heartland of the Cult of the Dragon, and it seems as though you've foiled them at every turn...and now this. If it's the Pool of Radiance they're after, they may be disappointed...but we can't allow them to get their hands on that scale."
    - "You're not alone. There are countless others across Faerun who strive to stop the cult from gaining control, whatever their true plans may be." [she shows a harper pin] "Against an enemy so dispersed and so venerable, intelligence is our greatest weapon. Can we count on you in this fight?"
    - If the gang accepts (or waffles), she offers them the pin "in case you need to prove what side you're on".
- scroll of *identify* from Yovir Glandon
    - Yovir is speaking with Simon in his office about funerary arrangements for an old soldier who was brought to Valhingen by his drinking buddies after choking to death. Apparently the man had lost his tongue by misadventure recently and was having trouble consuming food and drink. Tragic, but even more sad was that his friends refused to cover the cost of the funeral!
    - Yovir investigated the Welltran crypt himself after the gang cleared it out. "I discovered a very curious mist that seemed to permeate the chambers. Did you notice that during your investigation?" Yovir dispelled the mist, but was taken aback by the well-preserved state of the chambers. If Xandria was as old as most at Valhingen had thought, the dating didn't line up. Instead, he became reasonably confident that the crypt was constructed in the mid-14th century, when Valhingen was overrun with undead. At the time, few records were kept, so this would explain the mistake.
    - Yovir spoke privately with Brother Keefe after the incident. The shaken Keefe revealed that he had been passed information suggesting the Welcomers were using or planned to use the crypt as a secret entry point into Valhingen, perhaps to rob graves or plumb the catacombs.
- [Fillistrom's Apothecary](../Characters/Fillistrom%20Wunderkundoodle/%F0%9F%8C%BF%20Fillistrom%27s%20Apothecary/%21index.md)
    - The shop has a new item ([Tincture of Animal Friendship](../Characters/Fillistrom%20Wunderkundoodle/%F0%9F%8C%BF%20Fillistrom%27s%20Apothecary/%F0%9F%8C%BF%20Items%20for%20sale/Tincture%20of%20Animal%20Friendship.md)) that Fillistrom has been working on, now that he has Villonah home to help him. She has been venturing outside the city to collect roots, herbs, and animal parts for Fillistrom's shop. When the gang arrives, she's outside the city, but Fillistrom is around.
    - If the gang asks for free stuff, Fillistrom reluctantly avers: "Look, I don't want to seem ungrateful. After all, you did give me my little girl back. But I hear tell you've been all over the city saving people and killing dragons...and I do hope and expect you get paid for your work. I hope you understand...if I work for free, it'll be the end of my business."
    - Fillistrom promises to give the gang first crack at the new tinctures he's working on with Villonah's help, if they check back occasionally to see what's turned up.
- Cadorna textile compound
    - Bellia Barkshine, the affable halfling woman who runs the front desk, tell the gang that Braden left quite early this morning for the docks. He gave instructions for the gang to meet him at the Laughing Goblin whenever they're ready.

# Getting a ship

- Braden is able to source a ship, the *Kite*, that House Sokol uses for inter-city trade between Phlan and Melvaunt via the Moonsea. The *Kite* brings iron bars or pig iron West from Melvaunt, but its cargo headed East varies widely - most frequently wine or textiles. Trading season is drawing to a close since the weather is rapidly worsening, and the crew are happy to take the extra pay.
- Despite its name, the *Kite* is not particularly nimble. It's an older cog, about 60 feet from stem to stern, with a single large, faded sail showing the Sokol crest of a dragon rampant on a green field. It's sitting at anchor off the Northern shore of Thorn island, where the winds are a little less fierce.
- The captain of the *Kite* is a male human cleric of Selune (whom he refers to as "She who guides" or "The Moonmaiden") named Walteph Wiley, called "Walt" by his crew. He wears a long, worn-down cloak with a high collar made of deep blue wool and fashioned with tarnished silver buttons depicting the various phases of the moon. He is a quiet man who often spends his journeys praying, meditating, or reading, and cares deeply for the safety of his crew. They repay his care with respect.
- Other members of the crew include:
    - Leanne, the first mate of the *Kite*, a stout halfling woman with bright red hair
    - Evan and Tane, two upstart young brothers who are native Phlanites
    - Geoffry, a foul-mouthed but good-tempered older sailor from Hillsfar who mentors the brothers and cooks simple fare for the crew
    - Elma, a tiefling woman with red pupils who serves as the ship's doctor
