# Session Notes 2020-10-14

Date: October 14, 2020

- It's Marpenoth 16, a Tuesday.
- The only thing Rathene knows that the gang don't know is the info about the Claws: there are at least 30 kobolds in the gang, and Jeralla's second-in-command is a two-headed urd named Sharrak. Also, the rumor in the patriots is that Jeralla uses some kind of "magic book" and keeps it in her wagon.
- Rathene has been in jail for nearly a month.
- Iorg isn't a patriot, but he was promised a swift escape and work with the gang if he freed Rathene for them. They offered him money, but he decided he had had enough of the Grimshackles and he would do it for free. He doesn't know what the patriots are planning, but the message he was passed by a mole inside the Black Fists on their last visit to the keep a tenday ago is that they needed Rathene out by Marpenoth 20th, next Saturday.
- Iorg saw that the gang had come to talk to Rathene and knew this would be his chance, so he unlocked Walharrow's cell and set a small fire on the second floor to cause maximum chaos.
- Walharrow wakes up after 1d4 hours, which you can roll at the start of the session.
- The halflings and their guards are totally consumed with fighting the fire that's now raging on the second floor; they will not respond unless provoked.
- Braden is distraught when freed: "The point of our arrangement was for me to *avoid* danger! This has been a disaster!"
- When told about the outlaws' plan to make a truce, Braden becomes even more fearful and begs the gang to do anything in their power to prevent it. "This will be the end of trade on the Iron Route! Phlan shall starve, and her castles and guilds fall to ruin! Many will not survive the winter!"
- If Walharrow is interrogated, he refuses to speak except in Abyssal, instead fixing each character with a burning stare and cursing them repeatedly. He attempts to break his bonds as much as possible.
- If the gang attempts to take Walharrow back to Phlan, the Black Fists at Stojanow gate take notice of their actions and a small crowd gathers to follow them into the city. Cron Bolver is impressed, but not interested in paying a hefty price for the privilege of trying to keep Walharrow contained. He makes it clear that the Fists will simply execute Walharrow if he is handed over.
