# Outline

A harper/gauntlet/zhent contacts them via sending to check hwo things are going

## Cron Bolver

### Schedule

Cron receives messages through a cutout (in fact Ellison, who is no longer performing this duty), so he has no idea who is passing messages on behalf of the cult. He checks a dead drop once each day at dusk - a brick hole in an apartment building on the Northeast end of Podol plaza. He's been told that Vorgansharax will come to the town before the first snow of winter, and that he should be ready at any time to break the cult operatives out of the prison and ready his Tears to take Valjevo Keep.

After secretly checking the dead drop, he returns to Stojanow Gate for the morning prisoner inspection, a duty which he applies himself to with relish. This involves checking each cell for contraband, as well as harassing the prisoners and bargaining with them for items or favors he has the authority to dispense. He will check all the rooms inside the gate first, followed by the general dungeon underneath the gate.

After inspection, he will generally station himself at the foot of the gate to hear petitioners seeking to obtain a release from the gate or meet with someone who is imprisoned there. These services can generally be bought by the unscrupulous. He also bars anyone from traversing the gate who does not have legitimate business within the castle complex.

A few times a week, Cron will leave the gate to go "on patrol", taking his sergeant Yerk (a huge, mute man who is bald) along with him. While on the street, he pursues a "stop and frisk" style strategy, using the auspices of martial law to have the tears collect protection and other "fees", knowing he will soon be in power. He may visit other Black Fist units stationed at the keep, at garrisons throughout the city, or at other gates to correspond secretly with Tears he has recruited within those units.

### Interactions

[roll some dice here to give the impression of randomness in the schedule.]

If observed before the sun is fully up, the PCs can catch Bolver ducking behind the brick building off of Podol Plaza to check the dead drop.

If observed during the morning, Bolver will be inside the gate performing inspection duty. He takes his lunch at the Cracked Crown.

If observed during the early afternoon, he will be hearing petitioners.

Later that afternoon, he will leave the gate to visit (with Yerk):

- The New Phlan garrison, to check in with Lt. Urakh, one of the Tears.
    - "Have you had any more messages?" "No. None. Bastards have clammed up. But they said this could happen at any time. We just need to sit tight. The messenger could've been compromised. When they give me something new, we'll be ready to move." "I hate waiting to fight. In Thar we had to walk for weeks just to find another settlement. I thought the city would be more exciting." "You should try running the gate. What a fucking circus."
- The Castle, to check in with Capt. Barrelhelm and visit the Tears who are stationed at barracks there.
- The West Gate/Cadorna compound unit, to check in with Sgt. Ambershard (F dwarf), one of the Tears. She is going out to smoke.
    - "What's the crack lieutenant?" "Nothing. Still waiting. Gimme somma that." "Ye goona pay what ye owe? Fine, good. ...They'll be sorry they burnt the Lyceum yet, aye they will. This town'll be set right afore snoows come doown."

If observed during the evening, he will take an evening meal inside the gate with his unit, and then retire to his quarters inside the gate.

## Stojanow Gate

### Sirge

Sirge goes over the limit on his first *sending.*

> Wow, hey guys! Yeah, everything went better than expected. They made me say some words and bow to the Lord Regent and everything and I'm a knight now and-
> 

If re-contacted he tells them he hasn't given the amulet yet and asks if he should.

### Occupants

Which prisoners are jailed there?

- Dragon cultists Spernik (M human) + Fulta (F halfling)
- Pirate Walharrow (M minotaur) + 2-3 moonsea pirates (any human) from Walharrow's ship the *Abaddon*
- 2 former Knights of the Black Fist (any human), conspirators of Sahnd Krulek
- 5-6 Welcomers (any race/gender)
- Noble, Gallus Sokol (M human), disowned and imprisoned for failing to pay gambling debts
- Noble, Xandrilla Kovel (F human), declared insane by her husband and imprisoned "for her safety"
- 3-4 Commoners (any race/gender), serving sentences for fighting or disturbing the peace

How many Fists are stationed there?

- 11 or 12. Cron's unit comprises himself, Sgt. Yerk, Sgt. Layla Daargen (F human), and 8 other Knights, all of whom are staunch Tears of Virulence. Capt. of Chains Barrelhelm also visits the gate frequently to consult with Cron about the "welcomer problem" and inspect the prisoners and their lodgings, though he is not quite so sadistic as Cron. In addition, the Fists employ a gnomish locksmith named Kellen who reports directly to Capt. Barrelhelm and lives nearby.

How does one obtain entry?

- The right/east door of the gate is usually kept open, with at least one fist standing guard outside. During the day, if weather permits, a wooden table will be moved outside in the shadow of the gate at which petitioners can line up to request entry to the gate or send messages or objects to those imprisoned there.
- Entry to the gate is subject to approval by the most senior commanding officer currently present. Family members or spouses of the imprisoned generally have a better case than the general public, but the Fists tend to avoid letting anyone enter the building for fear they catch a glimpse of something they shouldn't.

What items are stored there?

- Simple food and drink for the prisoners. This is usually augmented by any waste food from the Keep's kitchens.
- Food and drink for the Black Fist knights stationed there.
- Manacles, locks, keys, chains, and other implements of imprisonment.

## Black Fist units

Where are they stationed?

- 3 units: Valjevo castle (A), training, defense.
- 1 unit: Sokol keep (L), protection detail & docks policing.
- 1 unit: House Jannarsk (N), protection detail.
- 1 unit: Stojanow gate (B), prisoner management, under Lt. Cron Bolver with Sgt. Yerk (mute M human).
- 1 unit: New Phlan garrison (O), general policing, under Lt. Urakh (M half-orc).
- 1 unit: East gate & Kovel mansion (M), general policing, under Lt. Aleyd Burral with Sgt. Arram Whitepeak (M dwarf).
- 1 unit: Valhingen gate & Podol plaza, general policing.
- 1 unit: West gate & Cadorna compound (E), protection detail & general policing, under Lt. Ambershard (F dwarf).

Who's in command?

Captains have authority over various functions of the fists: the Captain of Chains manages prisoners (usually at Stojanow Gate), the Captain of Swords manages any units assigned to general policing or defense (usually found at Valjevo Castle), and the Captain of Coins manages any units assigned to protection details (usually found at Sokol keep or one of the noble compounds). The Captain of Spells (vacant) usually serves as a personal aide to the Lord Commander and would be found at the Lyceum.

Lieutenants have command authority over their unit and receive their orders from one of the captains.

Sergeants are charged with maintaining their unit's battle-readiness, physical fitness, etc. much like a drill sergeant.
