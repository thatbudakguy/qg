# Outline

It's late afternoon on Uktar 4. The PCs are inside the room they were freely given use of for an hour in the Cracked Crown. Aleyd Burral leaves first, telling them to wait awhile so as not to attract suspicion. She tells them to contact her when their agent is ready to be inducted into the Black Fist, and to send him at that time to the Gate so that she can arrange for his passage into the Keep.

## Aya Glenmiir

If the PCs go back to visit/consult with Aya and Sirge, Aya listens to the plan they've developed to put Sirge on the inside. She agrees, with two conditions:

- They find a way to securely communicate with Sirge while he's enlisted. She knows the PCs can *sending* him, but mentions also *illusory script*, which she can use many times per day if necessary - if they can find a way to reliably deliver him the messages. She demonstrates this on Sirge to show the PCs how it works.
- He doesn't stay too long (the 9th commandment). She quizzes Sirge on this.

She asks what the PCs intend to do once they get Sirge established on the inside. They can't wait too long to utilize him, or he may be discovered. They need a plan that is sure to make Bolver and the rest of the Tears reveal themselves at a specific place and time.
