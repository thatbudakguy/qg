# Outline

## In Phlan

### Mantor's Library

The Lord Sage is in...

- The Bard Book
    - He does the exact same thing as Aya; see above. If he performs the spell, he's able to confirm that the book contains the spirit of a female Elf, and that her name is Eryn. He comments that she seemed young and healthy, not unlike young Declan - a great loss, surely.
- Krulek's Claim
    - The Lord Sage doesn't know one way or the other if Krulek is correct, but he is aware of Gensor as a somewhat shady presence around the time Krulek mentions. He was working as a scribe in Mantor's library back then.
- Kryptgarden
    - The Lord Sage knows that some kind of "crack team" is being assembled by the Harpers, but cautions the gang against doing anything they aren't comfortable with.
    - He also knows that the Cult seems to be grasping at straws - in desperate search of any way to maintain its hold on power. If they are seeking aid from Claugilyamatar, she will bide her time until there is a clear place to put her foot down - in other words, the consequences of this mission could be far-reaching. Convince Claugilyamatar that the cult is on its way out, and that could finish them off for some time. Conversely, if this venture succeeds, it could cascade into a confident resurgence of the cult all over Faerun.
    - The Lord Sage knows a little more about Claugilyamatar: that she's incredibly old, but also that she's fond of scrying magic. The gang may not even encounter her at all during this mission - indeed, they should hope not - but they should fully expect to be watched at some point if they aren't careful. If they do encounter her, they should use any means at their disposal to run, as fast and as far as possible. Such a wyrm is not to be trifled with - not even by the strongest wizards of this age.
    - He also says that he's been working on a "personal project" for some time, which has been difficult during the lockdown for an old man! He nearly thought the jig was up when the Black Fist came to guard him during the riot. He won't say more except that he had to find a way to solve the puzzle of how to bring you back to Phlan, if you were to roam abroad. He asks them what they're doing tonight and if nothing, to meet him at Kuto's Well at sundown.
- The Scale of Tiamat
    - The Lord Sage is ready to release the Scale of Tiamat to them, if they ask, but he's honest about its capabilities.
    - "This is not an enchanted item. This is a piece of the body of a god. Her flesh will seek out its mistress, and as she draws near, so will it increase in power. I think, too, that she does not so easily suffer missing a piece of herself. She knows where this relic lies, and she seeks it still. Perhaps she will be angered to see how the druids defaced it."

### Fillistrom's Apothecary

Fillistrom is in... but Villonah's out picking herbs.

- Fillistrom's shop has a new item ([Tincture of Animal Friendship](../Characters/Fillistrom%20Wunderkundoodle/%F0%9F%8C%BF%20Fillistrom%27s%20Apothecary/%F0%9F%8C%BF%20Items%20for%20sale/Tincture%20of%20Animal%20Friendship.md)) that Fillistrom has been working on, now that he has Villonah home to help him. She has been venturing outside the city to collect roots, herbs, and animal parts for Fillistrom's shop.
- If the gang asks for free stuff, Fillistrom reluctantly avers: "Look, I don't want to seem ungrateful. After all, you did give me my little girl back. But I hear tell you've been all over the city saving people and killing dragons...and I do hope and expect you get paid for your work. I hope you understand...if I work for free, it'll be the end of my business."
- Fillistrom promises to give the gang first crack at the new tinctures he's working on with Villonah's help, if they check back occasionally to see what's turned up.
