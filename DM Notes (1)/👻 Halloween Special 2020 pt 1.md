# Halloween Special 2020 pt. 1

Date: November 1, 2020

Introduction

Farian meets the PCs at the Lazy Fisher, an inn scarcely a stone's throw from the docks of Delthuntel. The inn is made of wood so silvered by the weather that the entire building appears to gleam in the morning sunlight. Inside, fisherman are sitting down to their second meal, having risen early for the dawn catch. 

When the PCs arrive, Farian is late, but has left instructions with Spider the bartender that breakfast is on his tab. Spider is skeptical of Farian's ability to foot the bill, but motions to a table in the back that is already laden with fresh hot bread and a local ceviche that includes shrimp and oysters. This is a common dish in Delthuntel, always eaten before lunch to preserve the freshness of the day's catch.

The PCs have a chance to meet each other over breakfast; feel free to let each player describe to the others how they appear & how they know Farian. Eventually, Farian - a light-skinned human with blue eyes on the shorter side, who wears his hair tied back using a variety of colorful handkerchiefs - arrives, looking somewhat hungover. The PCs watch him haggle briefly with Spider before forking over the cash for breakfast and sitting down with them. Despite the hangover, he has an intense, manic delivery and gestures violently with his hands. In a vaguely New Jersey accent, He explains why he's called them together:

"Okay, so! I know you're probably thinking: Farian, if this hustle's so good, why'd you cut *me* in on it? *And you'd be right*! Because I'm smaht. And that's why I need your help. So my cousin Dorian, he runs one of these "adventure outfits", right? Cutting in on your business, buddy! [he nudges Roler] Anyway, so a bunch of rich outlanders come to town a tenday ago. You're probably thinking, big deal, Farian, Delthuntel's crawling with rich outlanders. *And you'd be right!* But these guys, Dorian says, they were loaded. Dorian says you could practically *smell* the magic coming offa them! Bling, clothing, swords...you name it, these guys were rocking it. Here's where it gets weird: they wouldn't take Dorian's offer of a guide! All they wanted was information, they said. So that's what he gave 'em...*information*. They took off into the woods without looking back. An' ain't nobody heard nothin' from em since. 20 dragons says all that bling is waiting out there in woods for anybody with an ounce of sense to come snap up. Now at this point you may be seeing where I'm going here. And you may be wondering, Farian, if these guys were so stacked and they ain't come back, why make the same mistake? *And you'd be wrong!* Because I have it on good authority these clowns were clueless! They didn't know the first thing about survival. They lasted *one night* out there, max. An' if we decide it ain't worth it - we can leave anytime. That's my promise to you. So. Whaddya think? Hoid enough?"

Farian explains that the group was looking for a particular place deep in the woods - something about a huge Elven tree - so Dorian recommended a route that would take them past some known Elven ruins where they might be able to gather more information. The journey to the edge of the woods takes most of the day, so if the group traveled at a similar pace to the PCs, they would likely have spent their first night at the ruins. Farian's plan is to do the same, then see if they can pick up the trail of the group. If there are no obvious signs, the PCs can just return safely to Delthuntel.

The journey to the Yuirwood is uneventful, as the PCs pass through rolling hills that raise gradually up from the waterfront and flatten out into farmland. The farms are broken up by copses of ancient-looking trees, perhaps holdouts of the wood that avoided being clear-cut by human settlers centuries ago. The few people that are visible are common folk, working the land and preparing their goods to send into the city to market. To the side of the road, Farian will occasionally point out a barely-visible circle of moss-covered stones as an Elven ruin. None look particularly interesting, and there are no features at all to read on the weathered stones.

As the sun hangs low in the sky, the PCs come upon the outskirts of the Yuirwood. A few minutes after entering the forest proper, the PCs are surprised by a large boar that suddenly darts across the path a few feet ahead of them. Farian recoils, but tries to play off how frightened he actually is.

# The Temple

Read the flavor text in the original adventure here under "player introduction" (but omit the gargoyles bit).

On entering, feel free to describe the murals. If none of the PCs are interested enough to examine them, Farian points out that there is paint underlying the more obvious murals of the Abyss in some areas. The underlying paint depicts the Seldarine, the Elven pantheon. In particular, the PCs can find depictions of Rillifane Rallathil (a huge tree), and Aedrie Faenya (a flock of geese flying across clouds) with a DC 14 Religion check. With a DC 10 Investigation check, the PCs discover that the murals depict the geese flying to the roots of a tree growing at the north end of a building shaped similarly to the temple itself.

The statues flanking the sides of the temple look to have been ones of Corellon Larethian and Angharradh, the two leaders of the Seldarine (DC 11 religion), but have been heavily marred and are missing pieces.

At the far end of the temple the PCs can find the cache hidden via a removable brick underneath the back of the altar. Inside are two *potions of healing* and an ancient bronze censer, its rim encrusted with jewels, shining with an eerie brightness in the dim light. When lit, the censer burns for a moment and a strange music-box-like twinkling sound can be heard. After the tune plays, all fires in a 15ft radius are extinguished, as if by a violent wind, and a random item from the treasure table appears somewhere in the room.

## Prelude: Garvus

Read the flavor text in the original adventure here, altering the bit about the gang's bodies.

When the PCs enter the Rectory, Farian goes quickly to the bodies to search them for items, but immediately reports his disappointment: they are unarmed and unarmored. "Look at this one! Big half-orc. Whatever got to him must've done for the rest of them too." Describe the attributes of each of the QG in a way subtle enough to hint to the PCs that this is, in fact, the Quarantine Gang.

If the PCs poke around the bodies, A DC 12 Investigation check reveals that they seem to have fallen exactly where they lay, perhaps in the midst of a confrontation. A DC 15 Arcana check reveals that the bodies have been artificially aged in a hyper-accelerated manner suggestive of powerful necrotic energy. Garvus's body is posed in a kneeling position facing the altar, the skin flayed backwards as though it was made of wax. Describe the dim light of the necroshard, which still hangs around his neck.

As the PCs investigate the bodies and search the room, the light from the Necroshard grows brighter until Garvus and the corpses reanimate. Heads lift, followed by limbs. Garvus is a Wight, but the other zombies (of the Gang) are regular Zombies. None of them carry weapons or are wearing armor, so they use regular Zombie statistics.

Use the info from the original adventure when the PCs investigate the Necroshard, omitting the bits about it being from a meteor (but you can say it "looks unearthly").

## Wave 1
