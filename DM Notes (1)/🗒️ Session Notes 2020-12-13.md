## Denlor's Tower

### Meeting the Lord Sage

As the tired sun dips below the horizon, you find yourself standing just off Podol Street. Merchants and shoppers make their way back to the evening bustle of Podol Plaza and Scholar's Square, while laborers walk downhill towards the docks on their way towards their homes outside the city walls.

Next to you is an ancient limestone well, smoothed by time into a pale white column about the height of a dwarf. A set of steps leads up to the brink, smoothed by centuries of foot traffic. You huddle together under the wooden overhang, trying to keep out the damp of late fall. As you scan the street for what seems like the tenth time, you see a small hooded figure peel off of a group of southbound travelers and shuffle in your direction, a wooden staff poking out from under its thick wool cloak.

> I knew you'd come. I can hardly contain my excitement! Are you absolutely certain you weren't followed? Good. I'm going to keep walking South. Stay a good distance from me, but don't lose track of me!
> 

The bent figure of the Lord Sage merges back into the crowd, shuffling down Podol Plaza. His slow but steady progress takes him further in the direction of the docks, until he passes through the southern gate of the city wall, nearly at the Laughing Goblin inn. Pausing for a moment, he turns to the left and walks towards a row of houses in the shadow of the city wall, towards a large grove of annonwood trees. As you catch up, you see him furtively glance in both directions and then move with surprising speed into the vacant-looking lot of a large brick tower wedged in between the wall and a row of run-down shacks. Just as you approach the front of the lot, his small form disappears behind the back of the tower, vanishing into the shadow of the wall.

Standing before you is a tall pyramidal structure, three stories at least, with an imposing spiked roof and thin windows emitting no light - more a castle than a house. Some sections show obvious signs of disrepair, or worse - crumbling brick and blackened timbers indicate fire, or perhaps something even stranger. At ground level a large set of hammered bronze double doors look out into the street across a yard of waist-high weeds and brambles. In the half-light, you almost catch a glimpse of something shimmering in the air that flits around the yard - but that might be the shadows of the annonwood trees.

### Tower entrance

Unlike the imposing front of the tower, this rear area has a simple wooden door, well silvered from years of exposure to the Moonsea weather. Behind you, a high wooden wall marks the back of the lot, but you can hear the noise of the Stojanow river running just below as it rushes out into the bay of Phlan.

> You must forgive the secrecy. My obsession with Denlor's Tower is an open secret at the library, but if the Black Fists were to learn of it, I fear they would place me under house arrest! I've gathered every resource at my disposal to unlock the secrets of this place, but the true key eluded me until recently. To think of all that time it lay deep in the archives, until it reappeared on the forehead of Master Peregrine! Yes, I believe this is our ticket in. But you must be exceedingly cautious! When Ren and his friends visited so long ago, they were lucky to escape with their lives, and the tower has lain in disrepair ever since then. We must retrace their steps as painstakingly as we can, or risk doom carefully laid out by Denlor himself. Stay close to me, and touch nothing!

## Aya Glenmiir's Shop

If the PCs ask Aya to accompany them to Waterdeep, she is flattered at the suggestion, but turns them down.

About enchanting the emerald, Aya knows several things:

- Emeralds are associated with healing, regeneration, growth, and fertility magic. Emeralds might be embedded in the end of a wand used to cast a healing spell, and crushed emerald could be used to create the magical inks needed to scribe a scroll with such effects.
- Traditionally, emeralds are also said to detect lies and deceit. Kings often wear rings or jewelry with emeralds when negotiating because of an old legend of a king whose emerald cracked when he was lied to.
- Some sages name the half-hour called Waterclock, which encompasses the fifteen minutes before and after 2 p.m., as the most auspicious time to create magical items or perform rituals involving emeralds, but this has never been proven.

## Vang's Armory

- Bryce has a new item he's keeping on consignment: a *Mariner's Chain Shirt*. An elderly sea captain retired at the end of the trading season and decided to cash in his prized possession as a retirement nest egg, and has instructed Bryce not to part with the armor for less than 900 gp.

## Alero's Smithy

- Alero is offering a 10% discount on silvering weapons, since business is slowing down for the winter. He can do them on a 2-day turnaround.
