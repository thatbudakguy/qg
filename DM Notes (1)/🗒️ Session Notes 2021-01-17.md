# Outline

## The Yawning Portal

Bring everyone back to the scene of the beginning battle by reading the below.

> Shouts of alarm ring out as a hulking creature climbs up out of the shaft in the middle of the taproom-a monster with warty green skin, a tangled nest of wiry black hair, a long, carrot-shaped nose, and bloodshot eyes. As it bares its yellow teeth and howls, you can see that a half-dozen bat-like creatures are attached to its body, with three more circling above it like flies. Everyone in the tavern reacts in fear except for the barkeep, who shouts "Troll!" and promptly reaches under the bar to retrieve a weapon.
> 

You can give the troll full hit points to make this more exciting. The HAWKs (Spy statistics) will join in this fight using ranged attacks. Yagra also joins if she's conscious, but the Xanathar guild thugs run out.

Durnan (Veteran statistics) looses two shots from his double heavy crossbow, then jumps over the bar with a greatsword to attack the troll himself. He orders anyone fighting to focus on the troll, and to douse it with lamp oil and set it aflame when it falls. He matter-of-factly compliments all who join in the fight.

After the fight is over (or if anyone goes down), Meloon Wardragon and Laraelra Harsard arrive, asked by Renaer to "keep an eye on" the HAWKs, and so trailed them to the Yawning Portal to make sure no severe mischief happened. Henna explodes at Ren, taking her anger out on Meloon, who affably apologizes and offers to escort the girls home. Durnan tells the gang to let in the cowards who ran out into the street when the fight started so they can finish their drinks.

## The Long Road

The journey to Westbridge takes the better part of a day, moving at a steady clip. The HAWKs ride out in front, Al-Mandi's retinue makes up the middle (with many of the servants on foot), and the Moonstars take up the rear. The journey is windy but thankfully not rainy or snowy, with the harsh wind at times making conversation difficult as it whips through the empty plains north of Waterdeep. 

> Turning off of Skulls Street, you pass through a high gate into a sort of shantytown, with rickety buildings crowded up against the stone walls. The shouts and cries of butchers, tanners, and other merchants mix with the clanging of metal, borne to you on clouds of smoke that smell of burnt hair and animal entrails. After only a few hundred more feet, you emerge into a large courtyard, falling into line between merchant carts piled high with goods. Just ahead, the massive North Gate of the city stands open. At its feet, a uniformed captain of the City Guard shouts at a company of well-armed guardsmen, directing them to examine each of the wagons queued up in front of you.
> 

About 20 minutes after leaving the gate, winding through the farms north of the city, the PCs come to a well-trod fork in the road. A huge and weathered wooden sign points the way to the Long Road to the right, while the High Road continues to the left. Written on the sign are the names of great cities of the north, some of which the PCs have heard of: Neverwinter, Luskan, Mirabar.

One or two bells after midday, the group reaches Red Larch, a small farming town along the Long Road. Ren remarks that the town is a good place to stop for some food, and mentions Mhandyvver's Poultry as a local farm with some specialties. He remembers having crumblecake here when he would accompany his father on trips north.

Minthra Mhandyvver, the matriarch, will happily serve the group crumblecake at her farm store. The crumblecake has roots, nuts, chickpea mash, greens, and turkey and chicken all baked together, and it's delicious! This is a good time to warm up, and the farmers have a large fire going outside the store. There are also two friendly dogs here, although they're afraid of Aisha's cat Cyne. The party can't stay long, however, as they need to reach Westbridge before sundown.

### Conversations

**Eiruk Weskur** will talk about his work as at the Watchful Order, most of which is expended on behalf of the city's nobles (wards, bodyguards, enchantments, etc) although some of which is spent working for the public (e.g. summoning water elementals to put out fires). He is curious about similar arcane organizations in the Moonsea. If a character bonds with him, he'll reveal the same story as Lara about Vajra's choice of her over him as heir. About enchanting the emerald necklace, he has a few ideas:

- A *periapt of health* (DMG 184). Cost 400gp, takes two tendays.
- An *elemental gem* (DMG 167). Cost 450gp, takes two tendays.
- A *periapt of wound closure* (DMG 184). Cost 650gp, takes two tendays.
- An *amulet of health* (DMG 150). Cost 4,800gp, takes 6 months.

**Renaer Neverember** will talk about his friends' tangle with Khondar "Ten-Rings" Naomal, the adventure that led to his re-founding of the Moonstars. He expresses regret at how little he sees of Vajra these days, but hopes that they don't need her help with whatever's brewing with the cult. He can also talk about his father and his relationship with lady Laeral Silverhand, which he tries to downplay to avoid the appearance of favoritism. If a character bonds with him, he'll reveal that he finds her attractive, which he is fairly conflicted about - although the situation is even weirder between her and Vajra because of Khelben's spirit being inside the blackstaff!

**Laraelra Harsard** will talk about her relationship with Vajra, and the heavy burden of preparing to assume the mantle of Blackstaff whenever it passes to her. She can also talk about the difficulty of being misunderstood as a sorcerer by both her family and her peers, and her fear that she will become Blackstaff as a result of violence, as happened to Vajra and the blackstaffs before her. If a character bonds with her, she'll reveal the fact that Vajra chose her over Eiruk because of his romantic interest in Vajra, which has been awkward for all three of them but no longer hurts Eiruk.

**Meloon Wardragon** will talk affably about getting older and its affects on his body, or Azuredge if the PCs enquire (he refers to the axe as "She", as it contains the spirit of Lady Laroun, the former Warlord of Waterdeep over 500 years ago). He admits to being excited about this adventure, as the business of protecting his best friend hasn't been particularly exciting for some time. If a character bonds with him, he'll let them hold Azuredge - very carefully!

**Ahash Al-Mandi** will talk about how cold it is up here in the North! He speaks in the third person in halting common, with a thick turkish accent. He is uninterested in characters without arcane aptitude, but inquires of others how they came to learn "words of the spirits". If asked, he reveals that he was taught by his patron Jiraad, who disguised himself as a noble at the court of the Grand Caliph. He can also remember that Calimport was once leveled by a flight of dragons, and thus his people are no friends of dragons. If a character strikes up a bond with him, he may offer them some *trika*, a strong sweet wine from Calimport that his noble patrons, the house of Al-Qutaa, are hoping to sell to the Sword Coast once they cement a relationship with the Neverembers.

**Aisha Cantos** will talk about her childhood with the other HAWKs, but is mainly interested in the adventures of the gang, and what they know about the cult. Unlike the other HAWKs, she is a little apprehensive about this mission (but won't reveal this unless prodded), and wishes she was a little better informed. If a character strikes up a bond with her, she'll let them hold Cyne, her cat.

**Henna Castiglione** will complain about what she sees as Ren's attempts to control her, and flirt with whoever she talks to. She asks the characters to voluntarily reveal secrets, and starts with one of her own (which is actually not hers): Kirsten has a crush on Eiruk. She's not supposed to tell, but it's just so obvious!

**Kirsten Solari** will talk about the difficulty she had finding a group of friends who would accept her until she met the rest of the HAWKs. She was the last to be part of the group, but doesn't know what she would do without them. If bonded with, she reveals that she had a brother named Dunbar from whom she was separated before she met the HAWKs, when he was moved to another orphanage by the city adminstration.

**Winona O'Heron** talks little, but inquires of the PCs' fighting style, etc (with the possible exception of Calcey, who she is certainly interested in). She asks if the PCs have seen her black leather belt.

## Westbridge

Just as the sun is beginning to touch the horizon, the group arrives at Westbridge.

> As the sun kisses the horizon, you come upon a windswept hamlet on the edge of a great forest, its Eastern edge looking out across miles of empty grassland. Beyond the warehouses and inns of the town's central intersection, you see a trail leading West into a clearing filled with colorful tents arranged into several large clusters, the setting sun glinting off steel armor and weapons carried by the many humanoid forms milling about there.
> 

Renaer has made arrangements with Herivin Dardragon, the affable halfling proprietor of the Harvest Inn, for rooms for the Harpers, Moonstars, and Quarantine Gang, so that's where he'll lead the group. However, he realizes once they arrive that the town is packed with fighters, and the other inn, the Shepherd and the Rose, is already full. He's worried about finding a place for Al-Mandi's retinue, who seem the least likely to brave the cold.

At the Harvest Inn, the attached Derry's Tavern and Eatery is already nearly full with people taking their evening meal, including one or two locals, a few traders, and a large party of boisterous dwarves and humans who occasionally burst into song. The walls are hung with all manner of strange art.

Herivin greets Renaer warmly: "fuck me with a broom, the young lord Neverember! taller and handsomer every time i see yeh!" He turns a little gloomier when Renaer asks about the rooms, saying it's been a battle to keep them free, but that he'd do anything for the Neverembers, having never forgotten his debt (Dagult paid for the inn to be rebuilt after a fire, in a grand gesture).

If anyone expresses interest in the art, Herivin (irish accent) gleefully offers it to them for the listed price, adding "everything's fer sale!"

### Order of the Gauntlet

The dwarf/human party are Order of the Gauntlet paladins and clerics of Torm from Elturgard, whose armor bears a device of a sun and a star. If asked about who's in command or what to do, they will direct the PCs to speak with Ontharr Frume, the leader of the Elturel chapter of the Order, who is encamped in the field to the west of town. His tent is the largest one bearing the device of the sun and star.

### Emerald Enclave

The Enclave delegation is small - just a single Druidic circle and some rangers, all told about 20 people. Their simple lean-tos are pitched further away from the main camp to the west.
