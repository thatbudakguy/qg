# Outline

## Traveling to the Castle

Castle Naerytar is not just a stone's throw down the road. It sits fifteen miles from the work camp-fifteen cold, muddy, difficult miles. It takes the characters two days to cover that ground at a moderate pace.

Fortunately, the trail is marked by the lizardfolk who transport contraband through the mere to Castle Naerytar for the cult. Without the trail, finding the castle in this snarled, confusing maze would depend more on luck than skill. This trail doesn't make travel easy; the lizardfolk's trail is still treated as difficult terrain. It only shows the direction to go.

### Day 1

The first day's travel is by foot through tangled marsh. The ground is what passes for dry in the mere: even "solid ground" is soggy, with water very near the surface. Lizardfolk porters carry the cult's contraband on their backs along this portion of the trail, and their tracks can be plainly seen where the path crosses wet ground. Much of the path is through mucky, cold, kneedeep water. On those stretches, blaze marks are cut into trees to keep porters on the right course. No skill checks are needed to avoid getting lost as long as characters stick to the trail. If characters leave the trail, then a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check is needed to find it again. Each check equates to an hour of searching, which calls for a random encounters check.

### Evening 1

After seven miles of progress, characters reach a campsite at the approximate halfway point on the trip between the work camp and Castle Naerytar.

> It isn't much of a camp-just a clearing that's slightly drier than the muck you've been wading through-but four wicker lean-tos and a stone platform (for lighting a fire above the soggy ground) command attention in this wilderness. Three dugout canoes are drawn up near one of the lean-tos. A few dozen yards beyond the campsite in the direction you've been traveling, dry land ends. Other than moss-covered trees, fallen logs, and thick clumps of reeds, nothing rises above the still, black water.
> 

If characters arrive before dusk, the camp is empty and they can explore it safely.

**Canoes**

Each canoe has three paddles and is large enough to hold five humans without much gear, or two or three with packs and other gear.

**Lean-tos**

Inside the lean-tos are a few baskets containing smoked fish (edible) along with some lizards and birds that have been smashed flat and dried in the sun (very unappetizing to humans but edible).

### Lizardfolk encounter

**Approach**

As the sun begins to set, nine lizardfolk paddle up in three canoes. They are traveling from Castle Naerytar to the roadhouse to pick up a load of contraband. The lizardfolk expect no trouble near their camp, so if characters posted a watch, then those characters who are actively on watch notice the approaching lizardfolk automatically and the lizardfolk are surprised. If characters lit a fire, however, then the lizardfolk smell the smoke from quite a distance away and know someone is in the camp.

They assume it's more of their own kind returning from the work camp with treasure bound for Castle Naerytar, but the mere is filled with potential enemies and one never knows for sure, so their approach is more cautious if they smell smoke. In that case, characters with passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of 10 notice the approaching lizardfolk canoes before the lizardfolk spot the strangers in their camp.

**Questioning**

<aside>
ðŸŽ­ Call for a charisma check from everyone during the questioning, if it happens.

</aside>

These lizardfolk won't negotiate or converse with characters. They've been told by the elf who commands operations at Castle Naerytar that strangers in the mere are to be killed or captured but never engaged in conversation.

If they are captured and tied up, a successful DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) or DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check loosens their tongues. If the lizardfolk aren't tied up, characters have disadvantage on these rolls because the lizardfolk think them soft-hearted.

Lizardfolk know that they're transporting treasure to the castle. The "dragon kneelers" take it into the castle, and the lizardfolk never see it again. They are paid in steel blades (they have no ability to manufacture with metal) and magic talismans. All the lizardfolk wear necklaces and bracelets made of bone, teeth, feathers, carved soft stone, and leather. On close inspection, characters see mixed in among these things traces of civilization: glass beads, coins, costume jewelry, tiny mirrors, and stamped copper and tin amulets of the sort that can be bought for a few pennies at any trinket shop or souvenir stand. None of it is magical.

**Snapjaw**

During the questioning, have every character make a Charisma check. Whichever character scores highest makes a strong impression on a lizardfolk captive. This lizardfolk, whose name is Snapjaw, is unhappy about the situation in the mere, and he develops the notion that these strangers could be the key to driving out the cultists and to slaughtering their cruel bullywug allies.

Snapjaw tries to communicate with the chosen character, but he doesn't want any of his comrades to know. He speaks enough pidgin Common to converse in simple terms, in case no one in the party speaks Draconic.

How Snapjaw goes about opening a dialog depends on the situation. If he's the only surviving lizardfolk or he's questioned out of earshot from the others, he can speak openly. If several lizardfolk are tied up and they're being questioned together, he could sprinkle words of Common into his Draconic replies, such as "want to help" and "talk alone." If several lizardfolk are tied up and left alone for a few minutes, he could scratch a similar message into the ground. He might try provoking a character into a wrestling match or a duel (if your players are the type to take up such a challenge), and then whisper his message into the character's ear.

If characters don't mistreat Snapjaw and don't kill any more lizardfolk than they need to, he becomes a reliable ally for as long as they work against the cult and the bullywugs. Roll a die for each of the other lizardfolk captives.

On an even roll, Snapjaw persuades that lizardfolk to join his little revolt. On an odd roll, that NPC refuses to cooperate under any circumstance.
