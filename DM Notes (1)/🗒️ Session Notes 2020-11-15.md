# Session Notes 2020-11-15

Date: November 15, 2020

# Announcements

- Character backgrounds have been posted to D&D Beyond campaign
- New house rule: when you roll with advantage or disadvantage, read the result of both dice. You can say either the numbers on the die or the totals including any modifiers, followed by the end result, e.g. "a 5 and a 12, so that's a 14 to hit" or "a 25 and a 21, so 21".

# Notes

- The gang may wish to investigate the Grey Patriot camp.
    - In the main area, the gang can investigate the tents, which contain bedrolls, lanterns, 10 pints of oil, and about 20 rations. Anyone searching the bandit's packs finds 15gp in loose coins. Additionally, one bandit has a fine silk shirt with a wolf embroidered on it in gold, worth 10gp.
    - Sahnd is hiding behind one of the tents, realizing that whoever massacred his bandits is likely coming for him next. He has no intention of revealing himself and waits until the gang has left to make a break for the sea cave and the longship. Make a stealth check for him to hide, and ask the gang where they want to look for him. If they spend too long, Jeralla's forces arrive.
    - In Sahnd's tent, they can re-investigate the papers on the table to glean more information about Sahnd's plans. A DC 10 investigation check reveals that Sahnd was gathering a mercenary army to march on Phlan.
        - If they've already talked to Sahnd, this check reveals he was clearly bluffing about these plans - no mercenary groups have confirmed their support, and he doesn't appear to have copies of any correspondence revealing the Cadorna secret.
        - The gang also discovers that among the companies contact by Sahnd were the Company of the Raven, Hagar's former employer. There appears to have been no response.
        - Sahnd's chest, now open, contains the *Heart of Myth Drannor*, a heart-shaped emerald necklace. If Braden later sees a character wearing it, he recognizes it and demands it back.
- Sharrak:
    - "There was a mutiny at the human camp! Jeralla is preparing to march across the river *now!* If you wait, it will be too late to take down the heretic!"
    - "Jeralla's going to leave a skeleton crew behind and march across the statue's lap. She's already sent scouts to confirm your men have been defeated."
    - [he tells them about the scareman and the cave of captives]
- Sahnd, when cornered:
    - Kai saw the sail. I've known the merchants were after my head for some time. Just didn't expect them to send anyone like you...
    - So, you rob the poor to give to the wealthy, is that it? Have you really considered the side you're on? If you've set foot in Phlan, you know her people are starving. And, clearly, you also know her merchant class would rather pay assassins than address the problems on their doorstep.
    - What's the bounty on my head? That's nothing. You know, we don't keep our earnings with us, but you've just killed every man that knows the location of the cache - except one. Think carefully about what you're about to do.
    - I told Jeralla I had to return to camp, but she knows the game is up. She'll be on us sooner or later, and she can smell weakness. Like it or not, I think you need me with a sword in my hand. Besides, I know this place like my mother's house, even in the dark.
    - You can kill me now, but sooner or later, the armies of the Moonsea will be back for Phlan. I've already told them what I discovered about our so-called "noble" houses, and you can rest assured they find it just as repugnant as I did. The Black Fists may rule Phlan now, but they stand no chance against the armies of Melvaunt and the companies of Thar.
    - If my story ends here, just promise me you'll come for Jeralla too. That demonspawn has no business walking the earth, in the Moonsea or anywhere. Send her back to the Nine Hells to be with her dragon god. And tell everyone in Phlan what the Cadornas really are. Maybe they'll listen to you. They sure as hell didn't listen to me.
