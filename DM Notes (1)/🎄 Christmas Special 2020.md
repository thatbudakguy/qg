# Outline

## Moonsea Midwinter

### Intro

> You find yourself three days out from Hillsfar, headed East along the Southern coast of the great Moonsea. It is the belly of winter, near the end of the month aptly named Hammer, and the cold is fierce. You often catch yourself wondering what sane people live here, and how they pass these months without turning to drink.
> 

The party is headed to Mulmaster, the City of Danger, on behalf of the Order of the Gauntlet to investigate rumors that a coup is brewing. It's unclear if there's any truth to the rumors, but if they're correct, a cabal of wizards could be planning to seize control of the city, which would throw the whole Moonsea region into chaos.

As the party trudges through the snow, ask them to describe:

- How they're staying warm
- What they would do to pass the time during the dreary walking

### Encounter

As the day wears on, you come to a place in the path that appears to be marked by statues. From a distance, you can see two identical features sticking out of the snow on either side of the road, each about 8 feet tall. Snow blankets whatever features they would ordinarily have, rendering them giant snowmen, with only the vague outlines of bodies. The positions of the bodies suggest they were crafted to resemble humanoid forms in motion.

2 [Ice Golems](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/monsters-by-type/constructs/golems/golem-ice/) escaped from Krangel's Workshop. They appear as snowmen, but when the PCs approach it reveals the ice underneath. The golems have a noticeable *K* engraved in the ice on the front of them. Any PC who takes an action can wipe the snow off part of the golem; it attacks shortly thereafter, opening with its breath weapon.

### Blizzard

> As you take a moment to collect yourselves and patch the wounds, you realize the snowfall has increased from a trickle to full-on blizzard. You might have less time to recover than you think.
> 

They can make a group or individual survival check to continue, but failure may cause exhaustion. If they fail more than once, Gilgamir appears to rescue them.

Gilgamir is a young male elf, with a mop of silvery-blonde hair that comes down in front of his eyes and has to be perpetually shifted aside. He wears a large silver earring in one ear with a stylized tree design. He has an unsinkable disposition and sings constantly, with or without his lyre "Lia". He will heal any obviously injured party members. The snow seems to fall oddly *around* him, rather than right on him, as if he has an invisible umbrella.

If asked about the golems, Gil opines that they might have been servants of the Old Bear, a warlock who lives on the outskirts of town.

> Wiping the snow from your brow for the hundredth time, you see the outlines of a winter mirage swim up through the haze of foggy breath and steam: a tiny town buried in the snow, its peaked Elvish roofs poking up through the rapidly deepening drifts. Firelight beckons warmly from the windows, and your frozen nose picks up the scent of wood-smoke drifting from the chimneys of the small settlement. You trudge through a natural dip in the land, entering a bowl-shaped depression surrounded on three sides by forested hills. The odds of finding this place in a snowstorm seem about a billion to one, and it's hard to believe it's real.
> 

## Trouble in Elventree

Nearly all of the inhabitants of this small settlement of about 500 are nonhuman refugees from Hillsfar's era of the "great law of humanity"; most are Elves. Elventree doesn't appear on many maps, and sees very few outside visitors, especially during the winter months. When the PCs arrive, the townsfolk are gathered in their homes and in the local taverns to celebrate the Feast of the Hearth, a weeklong celebration of the Winter Solstice that ends on Hammer 30. On this holiday, the townsfolk celebrate the goodwill that binds together their diverse society by exchanging Hearthfavors, gifts between those who may not otherwise have cause to be close.

### The Crossed Candles

This cozy inn is run by the dwarf Siggi, whose ancestors have lived in Elventree since "afore the Elves e'en knew aboot it!" Her golden hair is tied into innumerable braids that whirl about her ruddy face as she gestures and speaks animatedly. The inn is a two-story half-timbered building, with vaulted ceilings. Accommodations consist of several large rooms with beds and feather mattresses. The inn once belonged to a wizard, Siggi's great-great-grandfather, and it is said to be protected by magical guards and wards.

When the PCs arrive, there is a great commotion, since outsiders stopping over is an infrequent occurrence and generally cause for celebration - and everyone's already celebrating! Gil explains the tradition of the Feast of the Hearth, and that in two days' time the townsfolk will all be unwrapping their hearthfavors in the final day of the celebration.

Gil takes out his lyre and plays a new composition, the story of the Old Bear's theft of Krangel's Hearthfavors. This elicits explosive reactions from the crowd at the Candles, including cheers when the children discover their hearthfavors from Krangel and boos and jeers when Gil describes the Old Bear calling on his magic to steal the gifts.

> His voice lifting in time with the plucked music, Gil sings the story of an old wizened gnome named Krangel, outcast even in this community of outcasts, who made his home on the outskirts of Elventree. Never joining in the town's festivities, Krangel remained reclusive for all the years he resided in Elventree, appearing only occasionally in the town center to bargain with the villagers for their scrap metal and mutter about repairing his machinery. Yet on the last Feast of the Hearth, on the day of Hammer 30th, hearthfavors appeared on the doorsteps of every household in Elventree, plainly addressed from Krangel himself! The children rejoiced, knowing that these must hold the fruits of Krangel's long labor - for what gnome does not excel at wild invention? But here Gil pauses to introduce a new character: the Old Bear, a recluse to put Krangel to shame, angry and silent in his age, come just these three years prior to Elventree and yet hardly shown his face at the market. The children say he lives in the woods and talks with the animals, whispering evil things into their ears and telling them to run far away. It is in the midwinter darkness of Hammer 30, a year and a day ago, that the Old Bear stole into Elventree to snatch Krangel's hearthfavors away from every family in town. His huge form cloaked in eldritch energy, the bear took each and every gift Krangel had given and spirited them away to his home in the forest, tearing them to shreds with his sharp claws. On the morning of Alturiak 1, the children of Elventree awoke to find their doorsteps empty once again.
> 

The PCs can order food at any time; Siggi will come ask them. The menu is:

1. Boiled Eggs and Lentils, Tankard of Ale (10 cp)
2. Stewed Sausage and Cabbage, Tankard of Bitter (7 cp)
3. Braised Beef and Wheat Biscuits, Glass of Mead (1 sp)
4. Salted Pheasant and Dried Beetroot, Tankard of Beer (11 cp)

The PCs can also engage in carousing or any other action they'd like to take in a tavern full of folks; feel free to let them roll for it.

Eventually, Siggi offers the PCs two rooms, with their first night "on the hoose", on account of the terrible storm - no telling how long it will last. They are shown to a serviceable set of rooms on the upper floor of the Candles; none of the others appear to be occupied (though there's only one other room, plus Siggi's suite).

When the PCs awake, they discover a surprise waiting for them.

> Padding across the cold wooden floor in bare feet, you open the door to discover an unexpected surprise - someone has left you a hearthfavor. Sitting just outside the door are four identical boxes wrapped in shining paper and tied off with red bows, clearly left in the night by some kind stranger.
> 

Looking down the hallway reveals there's a similar package for Siggi, but the unoccupied rooms have no packages. Gil fell asleep downstairs on a table; a package is visible sitting on the table next to him and he's likewise surprised to find it when awoken.

If the characters ask Siggi or Gil how the hearthfavors could have appeared, they quote an old rhyme about Krangel: "well, he sees you when you're sleeping, and he knows when you're awake..."

If the characters open their gifts early, any present townsfolk are dismayed at their evident disrespect for tradition. Inside is a tiny doll of a smiling gnome (actually a [homunculus](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Homunculus#content)), complete with red hat. When handled, the gnome blinks its eyes open in apparent surprise, and scrambles around wildly as though agitated. Eventually it attempts to flee in the direction of Krangel's shop, using *greater invisibility* if it can't get away on its own.

## The Old Bear

The PCs may decide to visit the home of the The Bear, but if not, he will come to them by nightfall on the 30th to attempt to foil Krangel's plans.

The Bear lives in one of the many caves that line the hills surrounding Elventree that shield it from the weather.  

> Buried in a snowdrift is a round, flat boulder nearly 8 feet tall. No other features protrude from the driven snow in this part of the hillside. As you examine the boulder for any sign of life, a grinding sound echoes across the hillside as it begins to shift to the side! Rolling gently to the left, the boulder reveals a cave entrance lined with boughs of pine and fir against which a tall and heavily muscled humanoid form is silhouetted. Flickering firelight from inside the cave shows the features of a male half-orc on the older end of adulthood clad in ornate fur-lined armor, his hand flickering with arcane energy as the boulder slows to a halt. One good eye fixes you with a critical expression. "You were expecting a real bear. Hmm. Come inside."
> 

In an inner chamber, the PCs can see the wreckage of hundreds of the gnomes that appeared in their hearthfavors, clockworks and springs exploding from their damaged innards. Wood slivers and sawdust are everywhere, and huge claw marks are visible in the outer shells of the dolls.

The cave appears to have multiple distinct rooms, their inside smoothed as if hollowed out by huge hands. In the central chamber, a room about 40 feet on a side, the floor is covered in furs and a large log fire burns, smoke vanishing through a portal in the roof. The walls are lined with living boughs of evergreen trees, and some rooms are lit by chandeliers fashioned from elk horns and other animal bones. The far wall of the central chamber features a large mural, almost like a cave painting, depicting a large number of mounted humanoids on horseback traversing a wide plain. At one end of the plain is a massive tree, its branches stretching up and out onto the ceiling. At the base of the tree slumbers a bear many times the size of the humanoid forms on horseback.

If the PCs ask about Krangel and his gifts, the Old Bear fetches one of the current year's homunculi from the trash room.

> Look deep into its magic, and you will see. This is not a toy. It is a tool for hearing, for listening. You see, Krangel is like me. He desires to hear and see all around him, to know the rhythm of the world and why it turns. I hear through the earth, and I see through the animals. And he is angry. The townspeople do not see or hear his anger, but I can feel it. But Krangel is also not like me. His anger has become the desire to hurt others, because they never included him or invited him into their homes.
> 

The Bear explains that he couldn't outright attack the gnome - too dangerous, and besides no one would believe him and he'd be thrown out of the town even if he was right. Elventree abhors violence, it's a perfect little town. the Bear's anger scared away all the residents even when he tried to play nice with them.

## Krangel's Workshop

See [http://dungeonsmaster.com/wp-content/uploads/Corwin_Riddle_Holiday_Dungeon_Contest.pdf](http://dungeonsmaster.com/wp-content/uploads/Corwin_Riddle_Holiday_Dungeon_Contest.pdf)

> The sound of clocks, gears, and other types of machinery drown out your entrance. The floor is littered with wrapping paper, bows, and unwanted toys; tiny, harmless dolls in the shape of gnomes walk purposefully back and forth, sorting supplies into piles. As you advance, the shop door suddenly closes behind you, locking with a complicated series of gears, bolts, and levers. Ahead of you, a large gate swings open, revealing an enormous construct. A fat gnome stands behind it, tightening a screw and laughing merrily. “Oh ho ho!” he says, in a mechanical voice. “Those elves were so generous with each other; I just had to get them something in return. I was just thinking I needed to test my little present before delivering it – thanks for volunteering!”
> 

The large prop in the center of the map is actively whirring and gears and levers are moving around violently. Coming within 5 feet of any part of it requires a DC 15 dex save, and the character suffers 2d6+4 bludgeoning damage on a failed save (no damage on a success). The machinery can be attacked; it has AC 14, is invulnerable to psychic damage, and has 60 hit points. When reduced to zero, the gears and belts stop turning, rendering it no threat.

When the Slicer is reduced 0 hit points, Krangel ejects but hits the roof of his workshop, killing himself instantly.
