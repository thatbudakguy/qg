# Announcements

- Nick has D&D beyond subscription now; this comes with some perks:
    - "Content sharing" can be enabled for a limited number of campaigns. It is turned on for ours. When it is turned on, any content owned by anyone in the campaign can be accessed by all members. Nick turns it on at the campaign level.
    - Homebrew items from the community can be used in our campaigns. Nick added a community version of the Buckler, which you can now use in your inventory if you have one. Note that it's a "magic item" because D&D Beyond has no concept of homebrew non-magical items, but obviously isn't magical.
- Nick is trying out a one-month subscription to Discord, which enables "boosting" of the discord channel.
    - You can now add custom emojis to the channel (up to 50, iirc). Go nuts.
    - The channel has an animated profile pic, if you hover it.
    - You can now stream up to 1080p 60fps in the channel.
- Nick is acquiring some new video/audio equipment in hopes of a stable setup that can play music as well as voice over discord; stay tuned.

# Play

- [x]  create map
- [x]  create homebrew entry for double-headed axe Hagar has
- [x]  create bios for the caravan guards
- assume that:
    - sirge is carrying a torch, and a scimitar
    - two of the caravan guards are carrying javelins
    - sahnd is carrying his greatsword
    - peregrine has cast *light* on his mace
    - declan/hagar have darkvision
    - calcey had a torch, but dropped it when the owlbear took her
- the owlbear is headed for the back of the statue's lap, near its belt buckle, where it has dragged the corpses of several orcs in order to establish a food store. it dashes in this direction and does not engage until it drops off calcey, who it does not immediately harm so long as she doesn't move or obviously show resistance.
- as soon as the owlbear vanishes, sahnd takes charge, ordering sirge to light the pyre in the statue's cup to provide them with more light. sahnd knows the owlbear won't have gone far, and is probably intending to lair somewhere here in the secluded area of the statue's lap.
- initially, the caravan guards protest that they never signed up to go after an owlbear in its lair. sahnd harshly silences them, reminding them that they owe their lives to the gang - as he also does (you can fudge a persuasion roll here for added effect). together, they can rescue calcey if they are clever about it - the owlbear doesn't need to die, just be distracted. after all, the owlbear is outnumbered twelve to one.
- sahnd reminds everyone that attempting to harm the owlbear will likely only anger it - their best hope is to confuse, distract, or slow it down. calcey isn't in immediate danger - if the owlbear wanted to kill her it would have already. it's saving her for later. sahnd asks declan and peregrine directly what magic they have left.
- the plan can be pretty freeform, but sahnd's basic idea is to use himself and the caravan guards as a frontline, with the casters in back ready to unleash something that can slow down the owlbear or distract it away from the vanguard if necessary. using the light of the pyre, he wants to advance back towards the statue until the den is located, then pull the owlbear out of the den and send someone in to grab calcey. sahnd is willing to modify this plan if he believes anyone has a better idea.
- when combat begins, Sahnd uses his leadership ability to benefit all combatants and attempts to draw the owlbear to himself and away from others, giving his life if he believes it will save Calcey.

# The Caravan Guards

- Arvin and Harumbr Copperpot, the two dwarves, are native Phlanites of the Copperpot clan, who once mined the Dragonspines but whose numbers have dwindled over the centuries. Quarrel with each other and everyone else.
- Dent, 40s, originally a carpenter and roofer from Phlan. Missing most of his teeth. Will generally go with whatever his compatriots decide.
- Ilham, 30s, former mercenary from Hillsfar. Short, military-style haircut and gold tooth. Shrewd and calculating. Likes hazing Calvin.
- Pike Coldroot, 40s, former soap merchant recruited from Zhentil Keep. Slight paunch, receding hairline. Fled Zhent retribution for not paying his protection money. Dotes on Calvin.
- Calvin Bramblebottom, 16, the shy son of Old Man Bramblebottom who brews cider in Kabel's Hill. Just a kind farm boy. Strawberry blonde hair, tall and awkward.
