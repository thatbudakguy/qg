# Session Notes 2020-09-16

Date: September 16, 2020

- If the PCs look for Aleyd, she isn't at Stojanow Gate, but Jhessail Greycastle is. Jhessail directs the gang to the Eastern gate of the city wall, where Aleyd is stationed.
- The dwarf (Arrad Whitepeak) who Declan previously interacted with is here. If they ask for Aleyd, he tells them she's on duty inside the gate. With a DC 12 persuasion check, he can tell her they're looking for her.
- Aleyd acts oddly and tries to signal to the PCs that she doesn't feel comfortable talking. If they find a way to talk privately, she shares that she's confident something is up: Spernik and Fulta (the halfling) have been moved to cells next to each other inside Stojanow, and they've both had visitors. The trial is taking too long. Additionally, Aleyd has been moved off of Stojanow and no longer handles shifts there.
- Aleyd tells the gang that they're attracting attention: all of the Fists now know that there's a company of adventurers in the city who apprehended some cultists. They've been ordered not to obstruct the adventurers, but also not to give them any special treatment. This order came from high up, so Aleyd guesses that the Lord Regent has warmed up to the gang (perhaps thanks to the Lord Sage).
- Aleyd asks where the gang is staying and how to get in touch with them, since she wasn't able to find them at the Laughing Goblin.
- The accountant at the Cadorna textile compound is a middle-aged halfling woman named Bellia Barkshine. She mostly deals with traders and manages the accounts for the caravans. She can fetch Braden on request. Braden goes back and talks to Hilda Cadorna (who is a distant relation porphyrys) if he is unsure how to negotiate.
