# Research for Declan, Uktar 4

# Vorgansharax

- Injured badly in a fight with a bronze dragon when he was a wyrmling, which resulted in a tattered and maimed right wing.
- Location of lair unknown, though speculated to be in the Far Forest, a marshy area on the Western edge of Anauroch, the great sand sea.
- Believed to be close to 800 years old, making him an older adult.
- Rough guess at HP (between 200 and 300).
- Immune to poison damage and condition; can breathe underwater.
- Blindsight, darkvision, high passive perception.
- "Living Treasures" - likely to prefer sentient beings bent to his will. Popular heroes, well-known sages, renowned bards...he would consider their total servitude the greatest reward.

# Khelben Arunson

- Born 414 DR to Arun Maerdrym of Myth Drannor and Arielimnda, a human ranger. Declan recognizes Arun (with a history check) as the first half-elf ever legitimately born to a noble elven family who was allowed to keep his elven family name. This caused a stir in Myth Drannor at the time (early 300s DR).
- Khelben was considered fully human, and was not allowed to keep his name, so Arun followed an ancient custom and allowed him to choose his own. He had many nicknames among the elves, with whom he studied the Art, but he eventually chose "Arunson" as an homage to his father at the age of 35.
- At age 50, Khelben suffered the death of his father under mysterious circumstances. He evidently came up on his father escorting several family members across the Sword of Anauroch, pursued by a powerful enemy of unknown origin. In defending his family, Arun died, and some sages believe Khelben himself also perished but was resurrected by the goddess Mystra herself. In any case, he resurfaced several hundred years later posing as a monk at Candlekeep.
- He arrived in Waterdeep around 1150 DR, during the tenure of Piergeiron the Paladinson as Open Lord, and quickly rose to prominence by offering his services as a mage. During this time, he created the famous landmark Blackstaff Tower which still stands on Swords Street, and is used as a refuge and place of power for the spirits of those who served as Lord Mage of Waterdeep after him. Not much is known about how the Blackstaff position actually functions, but there's quite a lot of hot debate among sages!
- Married to Lady Silverhand, the current Open Lord of Waterdeep and one of the Seven Sisters, a group of powerful arcane spellcasters that some mages claimed were immortal children of Mystra, the goddess of magic. Together, this powerful couple represented one of the most fearsome duos in the realms. Both exhibited magical abilities consistent with Chosen of Mystra throughout their lives.
- Together with her, served the Harpers for centuries through a variety of periods in their history. When the Harpers failed to respond adequately (in his opinion) to the threat to Faerun posed by a prophecy, took matters into his own hands by stealing a powerful artifact and secretly selling it to the Zhentarim. Was exiled from the Harpers as a result, and around 1370 DR, created the Moonstars as a Harper splinter group loyal directly to him. This event was known as the Harper Schism.
- Several years later, gathered a group of many powerful mages – including several Chosen of Mystra – to cleanse part of the High Moor, a region in the Western Heartlands that had long been tainted by evil magic and overrun by monsters. Gave his life, along with some others, to remove the ancient blight on these lands. Though his spirit is said to live on in the Blackstaff and his tower, some believe his body did not die, and that Mystra kept him alive in some way just as she did a thousand years ago.
