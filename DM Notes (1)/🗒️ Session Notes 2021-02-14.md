# Outline

## Phlan

The PCs will probably want to visit a number of people:

### Aya Glenmiir

She's been working with Sirge, training him in the rudiments of tradecraft. She's incredibly relieved to see the PCs are in one piece and confesses her guilt at letting them go. She asks how things went.

About Thalder's letter, she is stunned. She knows Sergeant Bolver and has long suspected him as a less than above-board member of the Black Fist, but this letter seems to clearly implicate him in treachery of the highest order. Even still, she's afraid that this letter might not be sufficient evidence to thoroughly ensnare Bolver. Perhaps the PCs can set a trap? See [Aya's Plan](%F0%9F%93%8E%20Aya%27s%20Plan.md).

About Alandra's letter, she is afraid because she knows the cultists will almost certainly come for the Scale now, since they are hunting Tiamat artifacts. She wishes the scale had never come to Phlan. She doesn't know anything about the Dragon Masks, as most of her time as a Harper was spent supporting operations against organizations more like the Zhentarim and Arcane Brotherhood in the Silver Marches (where she served with Leosin).

### The Lord Sage

About Thalder's letter, he is angry. He has been telling the Lord Sage for months to take a hard look at his forces, given that since martial law was declared they're the only thing standing between the citizens of Phlan and anarchy. The PCs will need to consider carefully how to use it. Their victory seems to have eliminated the possibility of Vorgansharax coming to Phlan, saving the town yet again. This may be the last the PCs hear of the Old Cult for some time, and indeed this may be the end of their power in the Moonsea at present. The Lord Sage will consent to any plan Aya and the PCs come up with.

About Alandra's letter, he has the same reaction as Aya but says he'll look into other ways to ward the scale, if the PCs don't have any of their own ideas. He can tell the PCs about the Dragon Masks if they ask.
