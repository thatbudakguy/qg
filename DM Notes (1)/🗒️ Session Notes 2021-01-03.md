## Denlor's Tower

The Lord Sage and Aya meet the party at Denlor's Tower at sundown on the last night of Marpenoth.

- "We've been afraid you'll go off to seek your fortune somewhere else, and leave us with no one to protect us." (you can play this up)
- "When I first saw that circlet upon your brow, I thought - 'this young upstart thinks he is worthy of Denlor's wisdom.' But then I thought...if the shoe fits? The shoes are large indeed, but you all have grown into them."

Aya urges the group to be safe, and to not do anything they feel uncomfortable doing. Their aid is incredibly valuable, but they should not get swept up in something that could put their lives in danger needlessly. Aya tells them that they will be looking for Lord Neverember to brief them, and that his friend Eiruk Weskur will be the one to send them back when the time comes.
