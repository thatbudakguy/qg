## Synopsis

Focus on Thay here? Could use material from "Dead in Thay", including stuff about the Bloodgate  (summoning portal) or the massive Doomvault dungeon. The Rise of Tiamat Mission to Thay is pretty short, so would be good to augment that. Make sure you use the Dead in Thay version from Tales from the Yawning Portal.

What if Szass Tam's experiments with the Chosen are revealed here, and Declan learns he has kin that are captive in the Doomvault? A serious dilemma - strike at Szass Tam, and the council loses perhaps its most valuable ally against the Cult of the Dragon.

At Xonthal's tower, the gang may learn a bit about the plans of the cultists not loyal to Severin. Perhaps this foreshadows the events of Act VII and gives the first hint that danger may lurk even beyond Tiamat's coming.
